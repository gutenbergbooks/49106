<h2 class="p4">A FEW PRESS OPINIONS OF VOLUME I</h2>

<p class="p1">“His most elaborate and systematic biography ... is not
merely a book to be reckoned with; it is one with which we cannot
dispense, if only for its minute examination of Luther’s theological
writings.”&mdash;<i>The Athenæum.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“There is no room for any sort of question as to the welcome
ready among English-speaking Roman Catholics for this admirably
made translation of the first volume of the German monograph
by Professor Grisar on the protagonist of the Reformation in
Europe.... The book is so studiously scientific, so careful to
base its teaching upon documents, and so determined to eschew
controversies that are only theological, that it cannot but deeply
interest Protestant readers.”&mdash;<i>The Scotsman.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“Father Grisar has gained a high reputation in this country
through the translation of his monumental work on the History of
Rome and the Popes in the Middle Ages, and this first instalment
of his life of Luther bears fresh witness to his unwearied industry,
wide learning, and scrupulous anxiety to be impartial in his judgments
as well as absolutely accurate in matters of fact.”&mdash;<i>Glasgow
Herald.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“It is impossible to understand the Reformation without understanding
the life and character of the great German. The man
and the work are so indissolubly united that we cannot have right
judgments about either without considering the other. It is one
of Father Grisar’s many merits that he does not forget for a single
moment the fundamental importance of this connection. The man
and his work come before us in these illuminating pages, not as
more or less harmonious elements, but as a unity, and we cannot
analyse either without constant reference to the other.”&mdash;<i>Irish
Times.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“Professor Grisar is hard on Luther. Perhaps no Roman
Catholic can help it. But it is significant that he is hard on the
anti-Lutherans also.... He shows us, indeed, though not deliberately,
that some reformation of religion was both imperative
and inevitable.... But he is far from being overwhelmed with
prejudice. He really investigates, uses good authorities, and
gives reasons for his judgments.”&mdash;<i>The Expository Times.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“This Life of Luther is bound to become standard ... a model
of every literary, critical, and scholarly virtue.”&mdash;<i>The Month.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“The most important book on Luther that has appeared since
Denifle’s epoch-making ‘Luther und Luthertum.’ ... It is an
ordered biography, ... and is therefore very probably destined
to a wider general usefulness as a Catholic authority.”&mdash;<i>The Irish
Rosary.</i></p>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdt">The New Church, with its binding formularies of faith and
its constituted authorities, contrasted with Luther’s earlier
demands for freedom from all outward bonds. The change
which occurred in his mind in 1522. What prompted the
reaction? Did Luther, prior to 1522, ever cherish the idea of a
“religion minus dogma”? His clear design from the beginning
to preserve all the Christian elements deemed by him
essential. His assertion of the freedom of the Christian;
the negations it logically involved pass unperceived. Greater
stress laid on the positive elements after 1522; the subjective
counter-current. Ecclesiastical anarchy. Modern Protestants
more willing than was Luther to push his principles
to their legitimate consequences. Conclusion: The reaction
which set in in 1522 implied no real change of view. How
Luther contrived to conceal from himself and from others the
incompatibility of his leanings</td>

Luther invites the secular authorities to interfere; his “An

new ideal: the Evangel not intended for all; the assembly
of true Christians; the Wittenberg congregation and the
model one established at Leisnig. The Congregational Church
proving impracticable, Luther advocates a popular Church;
its evolution into the State Church as it afterwards obtained
in Protestant Germany. Secularisation of church property
in the Saxon Electorate. Luther’s view as to the use to which
church property should be put by the rulers; he complains of
princely avarice. Secularisation of the marriage-courts;
matrimonial cases dealt with by secular lawyers; Luther’s

Philip of Hesse’s invasion of Würtemberg; the expedition

die Türcken” registers a change of front; his “Heer-Predigt

measures against the invader; he robs his call to arms of
most of its force by insisting on his pet ideas; his later sayings

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="pc lmid">ORGANISATION AND PUBLIC POSITION OF THE NEW CHURCH</p>

<h3>1. Luther’s Religious Situation. Was his Reaction a Break
with Radicalism?</h3>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">From</span> the date of the presentation of the “Confession” at
the Diet of Augsburg, Lutheranism began to take its place
as a new form of religious belief.</p>

<p>Before this it had ostensibly been merely a question of
reforming the universal Church, though, as a matter of fact,
the proposed reform involved the entire reconstruction of
the Church. Now, however, Lutherans admitted&mdash;at least
indirectly, by putting forward this new profession of faith&mdash;that
it was their intention to constitute themselves into a
distinctive body, in order to impart a permanent character to
the recent innovations in belief and practice. The Protestants
were prepared to see in Germany two forms of faith
existing side by side, unless indeed the Catholic Church
should finally consent to accept the “evangelical” Profession
of Faith.</p>

<p>It is true, that, in thus establishing a formula of faith
which should be binding on their followers, the Lutherans
were taking up a position in contradiction with the principle
of private judgment in matters of faith, which, in the beginning,
they had loudly advocated. This was, however,
neither an isolated phenomenon, nor, considering the
circumstances, at all difficult to understand. The principles
which Luther had championed in the first part of his career,
principles of which the trend was towards the complete
emancipation of the individual from outward creeds and
laws, he had over and again since his first encounters with
the fanatics and Anabaptists honoured in the breach, and,
if he had not altogether discarded them, he had at least
come to explain them very differently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Hence a certain reaction had taken place in the mind of
the originator of the schism upon which in some sense the
Confession of Augsburg set a seal.</p>

<p>The extent of this reaction has been very variously
estimated. In modern times the contrast between the
earlier and later Luther has been so strongly emphasised
that we even hear it said that, in the first period of his
career, what he stood for was a mere “religion of humanity,”
that of a resolute “radical,” whereas in the second he
returned to something more positive. Some have even
ventured to speak of the earlier stage of Luther’s career, until,
say, 1522, as “Lutheran,” and of the later as “Protestant.”</p>

<p>In order to appreciate the matter historically it will be
necessary for us to take a survey of the circumstances as
a whole which led to the change in Luther’s attitude, and
then to determine the effect of these factors by a comparison
between his earlier and later life.</p>

<p>Amongst the circumstances which influenced Luther one
was his tardy recognition of the fact that the course he had
first started on, with the noisy proclamation of freedom of
thought and action in the sphere of religion, could lead to no
other goal than that of universal anarchy and the destruction
of both religion and morality. The Anabaptist rising
served to point out to him the results of his inflammatory
discourses in favour of freedom. He was determined that
his work should not degenerate into social revolution, for
one reason because he was anxious to retain the good-will of
the mighty, above all of the Elector of Saxony. When the
Peasant rising, thanks to the ideas he had himself put forth,
began to grow formidable he found himself compelled to
make a more determined stand against all forms of radicalism
which threatened disintegration. This he did indeed
more particularly in the political domain, though his changed
attitude here naturally reacted also on his conception of
matters religious.</p>

<p>He treated Andreas Carlstadt and Thomas Münzer as foes,
not merely because they were turbulent and dangerous
demagogues, but also because they were his rivals in the
leadership of the movement. The “Spirit,” which he had
formerly represented as the possession of all who opposed to
the old Church their evangelical interpretation of Scripture,
he was now obliged to reserve more and more to himself, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
order to put a stop to the destructive effect of the multiplicity
of opinions. Instead of the “inward word” he now
insisted more and more on the “outward word,” viz. on
the Bible preaching, as authorised by the authorities, i.e.
according to his own interpretation. The mysticism, which
had formerly lent a false, idealistic glamour to his advocacy
of freedom, gradually evaporated as years went by. Having
once secured a large following it was no longer necessary for
him to excite the masses by playing to their love of innovation.
After the first great burst of applause was over he
became, in the second period of his life, rather more sober,
the urgent task of establishing order in his party, particularly
in the Saxon parishes which adhered to his
cause, calling for prudent and energetic action on his
side.</p>

<p>In this respect the Visitation in 1527 played a great part
in modifying those ideas of his which tended to mere arbitrariness
and revolution.</p>

<p>Now that the doctrines of the preachers had been made
to conform more and more to the Wittenberg standard;
now that the appointment of pastors had been taken out of
the hands of the Congregations and left to the ruler of the
land, it was only natural that when the new national
Church called for a uniform faith, a binding confession of
faith, such as that of Augsburg, should be proclaimed,
however much such a step, such a “constriction and oppression”
of freedom, might conflict with the right of private
judgment displayed at the outset on the banner of the
movement.</p>

<p>Such were, broadly stated, the causes which led to the
remarkable change in Luther’s attitude.</p>

<p>On the other hand, those who opine that his ardour had
been moderated by his stay at the Wartburg seem to be
completely in the wrong. The solitude and quiet of the
Wartburg neither taught Luther moderation, nor were
responsible for the subsequent reaction. Quite otherwise;
at the Wartburg he firmly believed that all that he had
paved the way for and executed was mystically confirmed
from above, and when, after receiving his “spiritual
baptism” within those gloomy walls, he wrote, as one
inspired, to the Elector concerning his mission, there was
as yet in his language absolutely nothing to show the likelihood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of his withdrawing any of the things he had formerly
said. Upon his return to Wittenberg he at once took a
vigorous part in the putting down of the revolt of the fanatics,
not, however, because he disapproved of the changes in
themselves&mdash;this he expressly disclaims&mdash;but because he
considered it imprudent and compromising to proceed in
so turbulent a manner.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>If, in order to estimate the actual extent of the reaction
in Luther’s mind, we compare his earlier with his later
years, we find in the period previous to 1522 a seething,
contradictory mixture of radicalism and positive
elements.</p>

<p>We say a mixture, for it is not in accordance with the
historical sources to say that, in those first stormy years of
Luther’s career, what he stood for was a mere religion of
humanity, or that his mode of thought was quite unchristian.
Had this been the case, then the contrast with his later
period would indeed be glaring. As it is, however, Luther’s
statements, as previously given, prove that, in spite of
certain discordant voices, his intention had ever been to
preserve everything in Christianity which he regarded as
really positive, i.e. everything which in his then state of
thought and feeling he regarded as essential.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Indeed, he
was even disposed to exaggerate the importance of a
positive faith in Christ and man’s dependence upon God
at the expense of man’s natural power of reason. “In spite
of all his calls for freedom and of his pronounced individualism”
he preached an extravagant “dependence upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
God.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> So far was he from the slightest tendency to embracing
a religion of pure reason that he could not find terms
sufficiently opprobrious to bestow on reason. We also
know that he did not evolve his doctrine of Justification
in the second or so-called reaction period, as has recently
been stated in order to accentuate the contrast, but in the
first period and in the quite early stage of his development.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">His Latin Commentary on Galatians (1519), with the new
doctrine of Justification,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> expresses faith in the Redeemer and
His Grace in terms of startling force; he requires of the children
of God the fruits of Grace, and attention to every word of
Scripture.</p>

<p>After that year and till 1521, the “<i>Operationes in Psalmos</i>”
prove both his desire for a positive religion and his own earnestness
in directing others to lead a Christian life;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the doctrine of
Justification therein advocated was admitted by him, even in his
old age, to have been “faithfully set forth.”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>As other examples which certainly do not go to prove any
conscious tendency towards theological radicalism, we may
mention his work on the Ten Commandments and the Our
Father, which he published in 1520 for the unlearned and for
children;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the sermons, which he continued the whole year
through; various discourses which he published in 1519, such as
that on the Twofold Justice,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in which he treats of the indwelling
of Christ in man; that on Preparation for Death, where he
inculcates the use of Confession, of the Supper and even of
Extreme Unction, teaching that hope is to be placed in Christ
alone, and that Saints are to be honoured as followers of Christ;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
finally, many other writings, sermons, letters, already dealt with,
dating from the time prior to the change.</p></div>

<p class="p1">In view of the statements of this sort with which Luther’s
early works teem we cannot accept the assertion that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
words “Christ, Gospel, Faith and Conscience” were merely
intended by Luther to lend a “semblance of religion” to
his negations, and were, on his lips, mere biblical phrases.
Louis Saltet, a Catholic historian of the Church, is right in
his opinion concerning this new theory: “A negative
Lutheranism dominant from 1517 to 1521 is something not
vouched for by history”; that the author of the new
teaching “had arrived at something very much like theological
nihilism is a supposition which there is nothing
to prove.”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">As for Luther’s then attitude towards the Bible, he actually
exaggerates its importance at the expense of reason by asserting
that reason, whilst well aware of the contradictions and the
foolishness of the truths of revelation, was nevertheless obliged
to accept them. The incomprehensibility, ever taught by
theologians, of many of the mysteries of the faith, for the understanding
of which human reason alone does not suffice, Luther
represents as an open contradiction with reason; reason and
philosophy, owing to original sin, must necessarily be in opposition
to God, and hence faith does actual violence to reason, forcing it
to submit, contrary to its present nature and to that of man.
Hence, in his estimate of Holy Scripture, far from being a rationalist,
he was, as a modern Protestant theologian puts it, really an
“irrationalist,” holding as he did that an “unreasonable obedience
to Holy Scripture”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> was required of us. According to
this same theologian, Luther starts from “an irrational conception
of God’s veracity,” indeed it is God, Who, according to
Luther, “by the gift of faith, produces in man the irrational
belief in the truth of the whole Divine Word.” Thus does Luther
reach his “altogether irrational, cut-and-dry theology.”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> If
the Wittenberg Professor asserts later, that no religion is so
foolish and contrary to reason as Christianity, and that nevertheless
he believes “in one Jew, Who is called and is Jesus
Christ,”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> this belief, so singularly expressed, was already present
to him in his first period, and the same may be said, so the
authority above referred to declares, of his apparent adoption in
later years of more positive views, “since Luther’s theological
convictions never underwent any essential change.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">If from the positive we pass to the negative side of Luther’s
teaching, we do indeed find the latter more predominant
during the first period of his career. An almost revolutionary
assertion of religious freedom is found side by side with the
above utterances on faith, so that Adolf Harnack could with
some justice say that “Kant and Fichte both are concealed
in this Luther.”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Neither Pope, nor bishop, nor any man,” according to what
Luther then says, “has a right to dictate even a syllable to the
Christian without his own consent.”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> If you have grasped the
Word in faith, then “you have fulfilled all the commandments
and must be free from all things”; the believer becomes
“spiritually lord of all,” and by virtue of his priestly dignity,
“he has power over all things.”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> “No laws can be imposed
upon Christians by any authority whatsoever, neither by men,
nor by angels, except with their own consent, for we are free of
all things.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> “What is done otherwise is gross tyranny....
We may not become the servants of men.” “But few there are
who know the joy of Christian liberty.”<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Applying this to faith and the interpretation of Scripture, he
says, for instance, in 1522: “Formerly we were supposed to have
no authority to decide,” but, by the Gospel which is now
preached, “all the Councils have been overthrown and set aside”;
no one on earth has a right to decree what is to be believed. “If
I am to decide what is false doctrine, then I must have the right
to judge.” Pope and Councils may enact what they will, “but I
have my own right to judge, and I may accept it or not as I
please.” At the hour of death, he continues, each one must see
for himself how he stands; “you must be sharp enough to decide
for yourself that this is right and that wrong, otherwise it is
impossible for you to hold your own.” “Your head is in danger,
your life is at stake; God must speak within your breast and
say: ‘This is God’s Word,’ otherwise all is uncertain. Thus you
must be convinced within yourself, independent of all men.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">The individualistic standpoint could scarcely be expressed
more strongly. The appeal to the voice of God “speaking
in the heart” renders it all the more forcible by introducing
a pseudo-mystic element. It is an individualism which might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
logically be made to justify every form of unbelief. In such
devious paths as these did Luther lose himself when once
he had set aside the doctrinal authority of the Church.</p>

<p>In his practical instructions and in what he says on the
most important points of the doctrine of salvation, he ever
arrogates to himself a liberty which is in reality mere waywardness.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">If the Sacraments were committed to the Church by her Divine
Founder, then she must put the faithful under the obligation of
making use of them in the way Christ intended; she may not,
for instance, leave her subjects free to bring their children to be
baptised or not, to confess or not to do so, to receive the Sacrament
of the Altar or to refrain from receiving it altogether. She
may, indeed she must, exercise a certain compulsion in this
respect by means of ecclesiastical penalties. Luther, however,
refused to hear of the Church and her authority, or of any duty
of obedience on the part of the faithful, the result being that the
freedom which he proclaimed nullified every obligation with
respect to the Sacraments.</p>

<p>In the booklet which he composed in the Wartburg, “Von der
Beicht ob der Bapst Macht habe zu gepieten” (1521), wherein
he sets aside the duty of Confession, he says of the use of the
Sacraments, without troubling to exclude even Baptism: “He
[man] is at liberty to make use of Confession if, as, and where he
chooses. If he does not wish you may not compel him, for no
one has a right to or ought to force any man against his will.
Absolution is nevertheless a great gift of God. In the same way
no man can, or ought to, be forced to believe, but everyone should
be instructed in the Gospel and admonished to believe; though
he is to be left free to obey or not to obey. All the Sacraments
should be left optional to everyone. Whoever does not wish to
be baptised, let him be. Whoever does not wish to receive the
Sacrament, has a right not to receive; therefore, whoever does
not wish to confess is free before God not to do so.”<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The receiving of Holy Communion, he declared then and on
other occasions, was to remain optional, although in later years
he was most severe in insisting upon it. Concerning this Sacrament,
at the commencement of 1520 in his “Erklerung etlicher
Artickel,” he said that Christ had not made the reception of the
Sacrament compulsory; reception under one kind or under both
was not prescribed, although “it would be a good thing to receive
under both kinds.”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>May we, however, say that Luther made the reception of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Sacrament of Baptism entirely optional? Did he go so far as
to consider Baptism as something not necessary? The passage
just quoted, which does away so thoroughly with the duty of
Confession and instances Baptism as a parallel case, is certainly
somewhat surprising with regard to Baptism. Luther’s train of
thought in the passage in question is, however, rather confused
and obscure. Is he referring to the liberty of the unbaptised to
receive or not receive the Sacrament of Baptism, or to the
deferring of Baptism, whether in the case of the adult or in that
of the children of Christian parents?</p>

<p>He certainly always held Baptism itself to be absolutely essential
for salvation;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> only where it could not be had, was faith able to
produce its effects. Hence, in the above passage, stress must be
laid on the words “no one can be forced,” Luther’s meaning
being that constraint in the case of this Sacrament is as intolerable
as in the case of the others. He, moreover, declares immediately
afterwards that Christ demands “Baptism and the Sacrament.”
Elsewhere, when again advocating freedom in the
matter of Confession and defending the work above referred to,
he says: “I will have no forcing and compelling. Faith and
baptism I commend; no one, however, may be forced to accept
it, but only admonished and then left free to choose.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Nevertheless
he had certainly not been sufficiently careful in his choice
of words, and had allowed too great play to his boisterous desire
for freedom, when, at the conclusion of the passage quoted from
his booklet “On Confession,” he seemingly asserts man’s “freedom
before God,” not only in the matter of Confession and Communion,
but also in that of Baptism. Yet the object of the whole tract
was to show what the result would be, more particularly in the
matter of Confession and Excommunication, were Christ’s
commandments in Holy Scripture put in practice, instead of
attending only to the man-made ordinances of Popes and Councils.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">One modern school of Protestant unbelief professes to
base itself on the earlier Luther, and, in almost every particular,
justifies itself by appealing to him.</p>

<p>Such theologians are, however, overstepping the limits
of what is right and fair when they make out the Luther of
that earlier period to have been a true representative of
that form of unbelief just tinged with religion which is their
own ideal. As a matter of fact, Luther, had he been logical,
should have arrived at this conclusion, but he preferred to
turn aside, repudiate it, and embrace the profound contradiction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
involved in the union of that right of private judgment
he had proclaimed, with the admission of binding dogmas.
Freedom in the interpretation of the sense of Scripture, or
more correctly the setting aside of all ecclesiastical and
ostensibly human authority, has been termed the formal
principle of Lutheranism; the doctrine of Justification,
viz. the chief doctrine of Lutheranism, was called by the
older theologians its material principle. Both principles
were at variance with each other in Luther’s mind, just as
there can be no composition between arbitrary judgment
and formulæ of faith. History has to take Luther as he
really was; he demanded the fullest freedom to oppose the
Church and her representatives who claimed the right to
enact laws concerning faith and morals, but he most certainly
was not disposed to hear of any such freedom where belief
in revelation, or the acceptance of God’s commandments,
was concerned. In the domain of the State, too, he had no
intention of interfering with due subjection to the authorities,
though his hasty, ill-considered utterances seemed to
invite the people to pull down every barrier.</p>

<p class="p2">In the second period, from 1522 onwards, his tone has
changed and he becomes, so to speak, more conservative
and more “religious.”</p>

<p>The principle of freedom of interpretation he now proclaims
rather more cautiously, and no longer appeals in so
unqualified a manner to the universal priesthood and the
sovereignty of the Congregation in matters of religion. Now
that the State has come to assume the direction of the
Church, Luther sees fit to make his own some of the conservative
ideas usually dear to those in power. As a
preservative against abuse of freedom he lays great stress
on the “office,” and the call to the work of preaching given
by superior authority. “Should a layman so far forget
himself as to correct a preacher,” says Heinrich Böhmer
when dealing with Luther’s attitude at this period, “and
speak publicly, even to a small circle, on the Word of God,
it becomes the duty of the authorities, in the interests of
public order, to proceed against him as a disturber of the
peace. How contradictory this was with the great Reformer’s
previous utterances is patent, though very likely he himself
did not clearly perceive it. The change in his convictions on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
this point had taken place all unnoticed simultaneously
with the change in the inward and outward situation of the
evangelical party.... That his [earlier] view necessarily
called not only for unrestricted freedom to teach, but also
for complete freedom of worship, was indeed never fully
perceived by the Reformer himself.”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The two divergent tendencies, one positive and the other
negative, are apparent throughout Luther’s career.</p>

<p>The positive tendency is, however, more strongly emphasised
in the second period. We shall hear him giving vent
to the most bitter complaints concerning those who interpret
Holy Scripture according to their own ideas and introduce
their own notions into the holy and unchanging Word of
God. As exemplifying his own adherence to the truths of
Christianity, the great and solemn profession of faith contained
in the work he wrote in 1528 on the Supper, has been
rightly instanced. As P. Albert Weiss remarks, he makes
this “fine profession with an energy which goes straight
to the heart” and “in words which bear honourable testimony
to the depth of his conviction”; it is true that here,
too, the contrast to the Catholic Church, whose belief he so
passionately depreciates, forces itself like a spectre before
his mind.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> “This is my belief,” he says at the end of the
list of Christian dogmas which he accepts, “for this is what
all true Christians believe and what Holy Scripture teaches.
Whatever I may have left unsaid here will be found in my
booklets, more particularly in those published during the
last four or five years.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Hence when it is asserted by Protestants of rationalist
leanings that Luther recognised only one form of faith,
viz. trust in Christ, and that he reduced all religion to this,
it should be pointed out that he required at the same time a
belief in all revealed truths, and that his doctrine of confident
faith in one’s personal salvation and of trust in a Gracious
God and Saviour, was ultimately based on a general act of
faith; “Faith,” he says, in a sermon which was later
embodied in his Church-postils, “really means accepting as
true from the bottom of our heart what the Gospel says
concerning Christ, and also all the articles of faith.”<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It is
true that Luther ever insisted on awakening of confidence,
yet the “<i>fides fiducialis</i>” as explained by him always presupposes
the existence of the “<i>fides historica</i>.”</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">With Luther faith in the whole of Divine revelation comes
first, then the trusting faith which “trusts all to God.”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>“His whole manner of life,” Otto Ritschl says, “so far as it
was directed to the attainment of practical aims, was fundamentally
religious, in the same way as his most important
doctrines concerning God, Christ, the Law, Sin, Justification,
the Forgiveness of Sins and Christian Freedom all breathe the
spirit of faith, which, as such, was confidence.” The Protestant
theologian from whom we quote these words thinks it necessary
to say of the contradictions in Luther which have been instanced
by Catholics and non-Catholics alike, that “at least in Luther’s
own way of thinking,” they were not such, for he based his
faith on the “revelation given by God’s Word in Holy Scripture.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>In the polemical writings directed against Luther, it was
pointed out, concerning his faith, that he himself had described
faith as a mere “fancy and supposition” (<i>opinio</i>). We would,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
however, suggest the advisability of considerable caution, for
according to other passages and from the context, it is plain that
what he intends by the word “<i>opinio</i>” is rather a belief, and,
besides, he adds the adjective “<i>firma</i>” to the word incriminated.
It is of course a different question whether the absolute certainty
of faith can be attributed to that faith on which he lays
such great stress, viz. the purely personal <i>fides fiducialis</i> in
one’s salvation through Christ, and, further, whether this certainty
can be found in the articles, which, according to Luther’s
teaching, the Christian deduces from the Word of God in Scripture
by a subjective examination in which he has only his own private
judgment to depend on.</p>

<p>However this may be, we find Luther till the very end insisting
strongly on the submission of reason to the Word of God, so that
E. Troeltsch, the Heidelberg theologian, could well describe his
attitude as mediæval on account of the subjection he demands to
dogma. For this very reason he questions the view, that Luther
really “paved the way for the modern world.” Troeltsch,
nevertheless, is not disinclined to see in Luther’s independence
of thought a considerable affinity with the spirit of modern days.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
This brings us to the other side of the subject.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Let us follow up the other, the negative, tendency in
Luther, from 1522 onwards, which makes for complete
religious independence.</p>

<p>Of one doctrine in which it is manifest Harnack says,
and his statement is equally applicable to others: “The universal
priesthood of all the faithful was never relinquished
by Luther, but he became much more cautious in
applying it to the congregations actually in existence.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
Luther, according to him, expresses himself “very variably”
concerning the “competency of the individual
congregations, of the congregations as actually existing or
as representing the true Church.”</p>

<p>The author of the schism, in spite of all the positive
elements he retained during the whole of this period of
reaction and till the very end, had no settled conception of the
Church, and the subjective element, and with it the negative,
disintegrating tendency therefore necessarily predominated
in his mind. It is not only Catholics, from their standpoint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
who assert that his whole life’s work was above all of a
destructive character, for many Protestant writers who
look below the surface agree with them, notwithstanding
all their appreciation for Luther.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Wittenberg,” says Friedrich Paulsen, “was the birthplace
of the revolutionary movement in Germany.... Revolution is
the fittest name by which to describe it.” The term “Reformation,”
is, he declares, inexact; a “reformation,” according
to Paulsen, was what “the great Councils of the fifteenth century
sought to bring about.” “Luther’s work was not a ‘reformation,’
a re-shaping of the existing Church by her own means, but
a destruction of the old form; indeed, we may say, a thorough-going
denial of the Church.” Paulsen points out that, in his
work addressed to the knights of the Teutonic Order, Luther
advocates “ecclesiastical anarchy” in seeking to lead them to
despise all spiritual authority and to break their vow of chastity.
The tract in question was repeatedly published as a broadside,
and passed into the Wittenberg and other early collections of
his works.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>From the Catholic standpoint, says Gustav Kawerau, “Paulsen
was quite right in branding Luther as a revolutionary”;
Luther’s new wine could not, however, so he says, do otherwise
than burst the old bottles.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">The “wine” which Luther had to offer was certainly in
a state of fermentation, which, with his rejection of all
ecclesiastical authority, made it savour strongly of nihilism.
According to Luther religious truth had been altogether
disfigured even in Apostolic times, owing to the rise of the
doctrine of free-will. “For at least a thousand years,” he
repeatedly asserts, truth had been set aside because, owing
to the illegal introduction of external authority in the
Church, “we have been deprived of the right of judging and
have been unjustly forced to accept what the Pope and the
Councils decreed”; yet no one can “determine or decide
for others what faith is,” and, since Christ has warned us
against false prophets, “it clearly follows that I have a right
to judge of doctrine.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>One person only has the right&mdash;of this he is ever sure&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
proclaim doctrines as undeniable truths come down from
heaven. “I am certain that I have my dogmas from
heaven.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> “I am enlightened by the Spirit, He is my
teacher.”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> “We have seen him raised up by God,” so his
friends declared immediately after his death,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and, so far as
they were in agreement with him, they claimed a heavenly
authority on his behalf. In spite of all this Luther never saw
fit to restrict in principle the freedom of determining and
judging doctrine; the meaning of Scripture he permits
every man to search out, the one indispensable condition
being, that Scripture should be interpreted under the
inspiration of the Spirit from on high, in which case he
presumed that the interpretation would agree with his own.
The numerous “clear and plain” passages from Scripture
which were to guide the interpreter, were to him a guarantee
of this; he himself had followed nothing else. The misfortune
is that he never attempted to enumerate or define
these passages, and that many of those very passages which
appeared to him so clear and plain were actually urged
against him; for instance, the words of institution by the
Zwinglians and the texts on Justification by certain of his
followers and by the Catholics.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">The fact that freedom in the interpretation of the Bible produced,
and must necessarily produce, anarchy of opinion, has,
by the representatives of the Rationalistic school of Protestant
theology, been urged against the positive elements which Luther
chose to retain. The tendency which, had he not set himself
resolutely against it, would have brought Luther even in later
years face to face with a purely naturalistic view of life, has been
clearly and accurately pointed out. Paul Wernle, a theologian
whose ideal of a renewed Christianity is a natural religion clad in
religious dress, points to the anarchy resulting from the multitude
of interpretations, and attacks Luther’s Bible faith for the
contradictions it involves. “The appeal to ‘Bible Christianity,’
and ‘Primitive New Testament Christianity,’ produced a whole
crop of divergent views of Christianity”; “the limitations of
this Renascence of Christianity,” which was no real Renascence
at all, are, he says, very evident; Luther had summed up “the
theology of Paul in a one-sided fashion, purely from the point of
view of fear of, and consolation in, sin”; his comprehension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of Paul was “one-sided, repellent and narrow,” and, in favour
of Paul, “he depreciated most unjustly the first three Gospels”;
the new theology “rested exclusively on Romans and Galatians,”
and, root and branch, is full of contradictions.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Luther himself invited such criticism by his constant advocacy
of individualism in his later no less than in his earlier years. “If
individualism be introduced even into religious life,” writes E.
Troeltsch, “then the Church loses her significance as an absolute
and objective authority.” And concerning the “whole crop of
views on Christianity” which sprang from such individualism,
he says with equal justice: “A truth which can and must live in
so many embodiments, can of its very nature never be expressed
in one simple and definable form. It is in its nature to undergo
historical variations and to take on different forms at one and
the same time.”<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> But this is the renunciation of stable truth, in
other words: scepticism.</p>

<p>Denifle put it clearly and concisely when he said: “Luther
planted the seed of present-day Protestant incredulity.”<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>“The tendency of the Reformation,” declares W. Herrmann,
a representative of ultra-liberal Protestant theology, was in the
direction of the views he holds, viz. towards a rationalistic
Christianity, not at all towards “the view of religion dear to
orthodox theology.” He is convinced, that “it is high time for
us to resume the work of the Reformers and of Schleiermacher,
and to consider what we are really to understand by religion.”
Religion is not an “unreasoning” faith in dogmas, nor a “non-moral”
assent to alien ideas, “but a personal experience” such
as the great Reformation doctrine of Justification rightly assumed.
Yet, even now, theologians still lack that “comprehension of
religion common to all.” All that is needed is to take Luther’s
ideas in real earnest, for, according to Herrmann, the “true
Christian understanding of what faith, i.e. religion [in the above,
modern sense], is, was recovered at the Reformation. Thus only,”
he concludes, “can we escape from the hindrances to belief presented
by the present development of science.”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>It is with a similar appeal to Luther that another theologian,
P. Martin Rade, the editor of the “Christliche Welt,” spreads his
sails to the blast of modern infidelity. According to him Luther
was “one of the fathers of subjectivism and of modern ways”;
Luther, by his doctrine of Justification by faith, gave to subjective
piety “its first clumsy expression”; the faith which Luther
taught the world was an “individual staking” of all on God’s
mercy. Yet, he complains, there are people within the Evangelical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Church who are still afraid of subjectivism. “This fear
torments the best, and raises a mighty barrier in front of those
who struggle onwards.” The barrier is composed of the articles
of the creed which have remained upstanding since Luther’s
day. And yet “each scholar can, and may, only represent
Christianity as it appears to him.” “For us Protestants there
is in these circumstances only one way. We recognise no external
authority which could cut the knot for us. Hence we must take
our position seriously, and embrace and further the cause of
subjectivism.” Thanks to Luther “religion has been made
something subjective; too subjective it can never be ... all
precautions adopted to guard against religious subjectivism are
really unevangelical.” We must, on the contrary, say with Luther:
“God will always prevail and His Word remains for all eternity,
and His truth for ever and ever.” “Let the Bible speak for itself
and work of itself” without any “human dogma,” and then you
have the true spirit of Luther’s Reformation, “the very spirit
which breathed through it from the day when it first began to
play its part in the history of the world.” This writer is well
acquainted with the two great objections to that principle of
Luther, which he praises, yet he makes no attempt to answer
them any more than Luther himself did. The first is: “Where
is all this to end? Where shall we find anything stable and
certain?” He simply consoles the questioner by stating that
“Science provides its own remedy.” The second objection is:
“But the masses require to be governed, and educated,” in
other words, religion must be an assured, heaven-sent gift to all
men, whereas only the few are capable of proving things for
themselves and following the profession of the learned. “Herein
lies the problem,” is the resigned answer, “which we do not fail
to recognise, and with it Protestantism has hitherto proved itself
sadly incapable of grappling”; “entirely new forces are required”
for this purpose. Whence these forces are to come, we
are not told.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>That all are not determined to follow the course which Luther
had entered upon is but natural. To many the Wittenberg
Professor remains simply a guardian of the faith, a bulwark of
conservatism, and even the safety-valve he opened many would
fain see closed again. Characteristic of this group is the complaint
recently brought forward by the Evangelical “Monatskorrespondenz”
against Friedrich Nietzsche, for having described
Luther’s reformation, with scant respect, as the “Peasant
Revolt of the mind,” and spoken of the “destruction of throne
and altar” which he had brought about.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">If, from the above, we attempt to judge of the range of
Luther’s so-called “reaction” in his second period, we
find that it can no more be regarded as a return to positive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
beliefs than his first period can be described as almost
wholly Rationalistic. In both cases we should be guilty of
exaggeration; in the one stage as well as in the other there
is a seething mixture of radical principles and tendencies
on the one hand, and of Christian faith and more positive
ones on the other. In his earlier years, however, Luther
allows the former, and, in the second, the latter to predominate.
Formerly, at the outset of the struggle, he had been
anxious to emphasise his discovery which was to be the
loosing of imaginary bonds, while the old beliefs he still
shared naturally retreated more or less into the background;
now, owing partly to his calmer mode of thought, partly to
insure greater stability to his work and in order to shake off
the troublesome extremists, Luther was more disposed to
display the obverse of the medal with the symbols of faith
and order, without however repudiating the reverse with the
cap of liberty. How he contrived to reconcile these contradictions
in his own mind belongs to the difficult study of his
psychology. On account of these contradictions he must
not, however, be termed a theological nihilist, since he
made the warmest profession of faith in the principles of
Christianity; neither may he be called a hero of positive
faith, seeing that he bases everything on his private acceptance.
To describe him rightly we should have to call him
the man of contradictions, for he was in contradiction not
merely with the Church, but even with himself. The only
result of the so-called reaction in Luther during the ‘twenties,
and later, was the bringing into greater prominence of this
inner spirit of contradiction.</p>

<p>The startling antagonism between negation and belief
within his mind found expression in his whole action.
Though his character, his vivacity, imaginativeness and
rashness concealed to some extent the rift, his incessant
public struggles also doing their part in preventing him from
becoming wholly alive to the contradictions in his soul, yet
in his general behaviour, in his speech, writings and actions
we find that instability, restlessness and inconstancy which
were the results at once of this contrast and of the fierce
struggle going on within him. The vehemence which so
frequently carries him away was a product of this state of
ferment. Often we find him attempting to smother his
consciousness of it by recourse to jesting. His conviviality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and his splendid gift of sympathy concealed from his friends
the antagonism he bore within him. All that the public,
and most of his readers, perceived was the mighty force of
his eloquence and personality and the wealth and freshness
of his imagery. They sufficed to hide from the common
herd the discrepancies and flaws inherent in his standpoint.</p>

<p>Wealth and versatility, such are the terms sometimes
applied by Protestants to the frequent contradictions met
with in his statements. In the same way the ambiguity of
Kant’s philosophy has been accounted one of its special
advantages, whereas ambiguity really denotes a lack of
sequence and coherence, or at the very least a lack of
clearness. Truth undefiled displays both wealth and
beauty without admixture of obscurity or of ambiguity.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Luther’s “wealth” was thus described by Adolf Hausrath:
“Every word Luther utters plays in a hundred lights and every
eye meets with a different radiance, which it would gladly fix.
His personality also presents a hundred problems. Of all great
men Luther was the most paradoxical. The very union, so characteristic
of him, of mother-wit and melancholy is quite peculiar.
His wanton humour seems at times to make a plaything of the
whole world, yet the next moment this seemingly incurable
humorist is oppressed with the deepest melancholy, so that he
knows not what to do with himself.... In one corner of his
heart lurks a demon of defiance who, when roused, carries away
the submissive monk to outbursts which he himself recognises as
the work of some alien force, stronger than his firmest resolutions.
He was the greatest revolutionary of the age and yet he was a
conservative theologian, yea, conservative to obstinacy....
He insisted at times upon the letter as though the salvation of
the entire Church depended upon it, and yet we find him rejecting
whole books of the Bible and denying their Apostolic spirit.
Reason appears to him as a temptress from the regions of enchantment,
intellect as a mere rogue, who proves to his own satisfaction
just what he is desirous of seeing proved, and yet, armed
with this same reason and intellect, Luther went out boldly into
the battle-fields of the prolonged religious war.”<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p></div>


<h3>2. From the Congregational to the State Church
Secularisations</h3>

<p>In the first stage of his revolt against the Church, Luther
had imagined that the new order of things could be brought
about amongst his followers merely by his declaiming against
outward forms; repeatedly he asserted that the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
life consisted wholly in faith and charity, that faith would
display its power spontaneously in good works, and that thus
everything would arrange itself; a new and better Church
would spring up within the old one, though minus a hierarchy,
minus all false doctrine and holiness-by-works.</p>

<p>Up to the commencement of the ‘twenties his efforts had,
in fact, been directed not to the setting up of new congregations
but to the reconstruction of the existing Church
system. Previous to his drafting of the plan comprised in the
writing he sent to Prague, on the appointment of ecclesiastical
ministers (vol. ii., p. 111 f.), in which we find the
congregational organisation proposed as a model for the
German Church, he was as yet merely desirous of paving
the way for what he looked on as a reformation within the
already existing Church, and this by means of the rulers
and nobles.</p>

<p>His work “An den christlichen Adel,” to which we must
now return in order to consider it from this particular standpoint,
was composed with this object. By it he sought to
rouse the rulers and those in power who had opened their
hearts to the “Christian” faith, i.e. to the new Evangel,
to take in hand the moral and religious reformation on the
lines indicated by himself. Thus he appealed, as almost all
sectarians had instinctively done from the very first, to the
secular authorities and the power of the Princes in order to
attain his special ecclesiastical ends. The secular Estates,
already covetous of increased power and independence,
were invited in these fiery pages to take their stand against
the Papacy and the hierarchy, just as they would against
“a destroyer of Christendom,”<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and “to punish them
severely” on account of divers disorders and “for their
abuse of excommunication and their shocking blasphemies
against the name of God,”<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> in short, “to put an end to the
whole affair.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The last words, found in the writing “On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
good works,” were addressed to the “King, the Princes,
Nobles, Townships and people generally.”</p>

<p>Thus to force the two powers, secular and ecclesiastical,
out of their spheres, handing over the supervision of the
Church to the secular authorities<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> can only be characterised
as an attack upon the whole Christian and moral order of
things, on the whole previous development of the Church
and on the highest principles of religion. It is true that the
Catholic States had already appropriated many of the
rights really appertaining to the Church, but to carry their
interference so far as Luther advised, had never yet occurred
to them. Indeed, the subversion of order planned by Luther
was so great, that the impossibility of carrying out his
project must have speedily become apparent to him. As a
matter of fact, the actual number of those whose hearts had
been awakened by the Evangel to the extent of sharing
Luther’s extreme views was not at all considerable.</p>

<p>When anxious friends pointed out to Luther how
revolutionary his undertaking was, his excuse was merely
this: “I am blameless, seeing that my only object is to
induce the nobles of Germany to set a limit to the encroachments
of the Romanists by passing resolutions and
edicts, not by means of the sword; for to fight against an
unwarlike clergy would be like fighting against women and
children.”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Hence, so long as no blood was shed, the overthrow
of the legal status of the Church met with his full
approval.</p>

<p>The torrents of angry abuse which Luther soon afterwards
poured forth upon those in power because they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
not follow his call and allow themselves to be “awakened,”
were simply proofs of the futility of his plan.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">No demagogue had ever before filled Germany with such noisy
abuse of the Princes as Luther now did in works intended for the
masses, where he declared, for instance, that “God has sent our
Rulers mad”; that “they command their subjects just what
they please”; that they are “scamps” and “fools”; that he is
forced to resist, “at least by word,” these “ungracious Lords
and angry squires” on account of their “blasphemies against
the Divine Majesty.”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> He denounced them to the populace as
having heaped together their “gold and goods” unjustly, just
as “Nimrod had acquired his goods and his gold.”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> He accuses
them “of allowing everything to drift, and of hindering one
another”; “plenty of them even vindicate the cause of Antichrist,”<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
therefore the Judgment of God must fall upon our
“raving Princes.” “God has blinded them and made them
stupid that they may run headlong to destruction.”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>This he wrote on the eve of the fearful events of the Peasant
Rising.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Thus his ideal of the future was now shattered, viz. the
spiritual society and new Christendom which he had planned
to establish with the help of the Princes. “This dream
passed rapidly away. All that remained was a deep-seated
pessimism.... From that time the persuasion grew on
him that the world will always remain the same, that it can
never be governed according to the Evangel and can never
be rendered really Christian; likewise, that true Christians
will always be but few in number.”<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Hence these few Christians must become the object of his
solicitude. He is more and more inspired by the fantastic
notion that Popery is to be speedily overthrown by God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Himself, by His Word and by the breath of His Mouth. In
the meantime he expects the new Church to develop spontaneously
from the congregations by the power of God,
even though at first it should consist of only a small number
of faithful souls.</p>

<p>The congregational ideal, as a passing stage in his theory
of Church formation, absorbed him, as we have already
seen, more particularly from the year 1523. The congregations
were to be self-supporting after once the new teaching
had been introduced amongst them. In accordance with the
Evangel, they were to be quite independent and to choose
their own spiritual overseers. From among these, superintendents
were to be selected, to be at the head of the
congregations of the country, and as it were general-bishops,
assisted by visitors, of course all laymen, no less than those
from whom they derived their authority and by whom, for
instance for bad doctrine, they might be removed. The
above-mentioned letter sent to Prague, on the appointment
of ministers in the Church (1523), contained further details.
Other statements made by Luther about that same time,
and already quoted, supply what is here lacking; for instance,
his ascribing to each member of the congregation the right
of judging of doctrine and of humbly correcting the preacher,
should he err, even before the whole assembly, according
to the Spirit of God which inspires him.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Thus he had relinquished the idea of proceeding by means
of the assistance of the Princes and nobles, and had come to
place all his hopes in the fruitfulness and productive power
of the congregational life.</p>

<p>But here again he met with nothing but disappointment.
It was not encouraging to find, that, on the introduction of
the new teaching and in the struggle against alleged formalism
and holiness-by-works, what Christian spirit previously
existed was inclined to take to flight, whilst an unevangelical
spirit obtruded itself everywhere. Hence his enlargement
of his earlier congregational theory by the scheme
for singling out the faithful, i.e. the true Christians, and
forming of them a special community.</p>

<p>Just as his belief in the spontaneous formation of a new
state of things testified to his abnormal idealism, so this new
idea of an assembly within the congregation displays his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
utter lack of any practical spirit of organisation. As to how
far this perfecting of his congregational Churches tended to
produce a sort of esoteric Church, will be discussed elsewhere
(vol. v., xxix., 8).</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">As his starting-point in this later theory he took the proposition,
which he believed could be reconciled with the Gospel,
viz. that the Gospel is not for all; it is not intended for the “hard-hearted”
who “do not accept it and are not amenable to it,”
it is not meant for “open sinners, steeped in great vices; even
though they may listen to it and not resist it, yet it does not
trouble them much”; still less is it for those, “worst of all men,
who go so far as to persecute the Gospel.” “These three classes
have nothing to do with the Gospel, nor do we preach to such as
these; I only wish we could go further and punish them, the unmannerly
hogs, who prate much of it but all to no purpose, as
though it [the Gospel] were a romance of Dietrich of Bern, or
some such-like tale. If a man wants to be a pig, let him think
of the things which are a pig’s. Would that I could exclude such
men from the sermons.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>In reality, as is evident from passages already quoted and as
Luther here again goes on to point out, the Gospel was intended
for “simple” consciences, for those who, “though they may at
times stumble, are displeased with themselves, feel their malady
and would gladly be rid of it, and whose hearts are therefore not
hardened. These must be stirred up and drawn to Christ. To
none other than these have we ever preached.” The latter
assertion is not, of course, to be taken quite literally. It is,
however, correct that he considered only the true believers as real
members of the Church, for these alone, viz. for people who had
been touched by the Spirit of God and recognised their sins,
was his preaching intended.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> These too it was whom he desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to unite if possible into an ordered body. Side by side with this
he saw in his mind the great congregational Church, termed by
him the “masses”; this Church seemed, however, to him, less
a Church than a field for missionary labour, for its members were
yet to be converted. The idea of a popular Church was, nevertheless,
not altogether excluded by the theory of the separate
Church of the true believers.</p></div>

<p class="p1">More particularly at Wittenberg he was desirous of seeing
this segregation of the “Christians” carried out, quietly
and little by little. He prudently abstained from exerting
his own influence for its realisation, and preferred to wait
for it to develop spontaneously “under the Spirit of God.”
The idea was, as a matter of fact, far too vague. He also
felt that neither he nor the others possessed the necessary
spiritual authority for guiding hearts towards this goal, for
preserving peace within the newly founded communities, or
for defending them against the hostile elements outside.
As for his favourite comparison of his theory of the congregation
with that in vogue in Apostolic times, it was one which
could not stand examination. His congregations lacked
everything&mdash;the moral foundation, the Spirit from above,
independent spiritual authority and able, God-enlightened
superiors to act as their organs and centres.</p>

<p>At Leisnig in the Saxon Electorate (cf. vol. ii., p. 113)
an attempt to call an ideal evangelical community into
existence was made in 1523, the Church property being
illegally confiscated by the magistrates and members of the
parish, and the ancient right of the neighbouring Cistercian
house to appoint the parish-priest being set at nought by
the congregation choosing its own pastor; here the inevitable
dissensions at once broke out within the community and
the whole thing was a failure. The internal confusion to
which the congregation would be exposed through the
doctrine of private illumination and “apostolic” rights, is
clear from the very title of the work which Luther composed
for Leisnig: “That a Christian assembly or parish has the
right and power to judge of doctrine and to give the call to,
and appoint and remove, its pastors,” etc.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of the evident impracticability of the scheme,
the phantom of the congregational Church engrossed the
author of the ecclesiastical schism for about ten years. Nor
did he ever cease to cherish the idea of the Church apart.
It was this idea which inspired the attacks contained in
his sermons upon the multitude of lazy, indolent and unbelieving
souls to whom it was useless to preach and who,
even after death, were only fit for the flaying-ground because
during life they had infected the invisible, living community.
He is heedless of what must result, in the towns,
villages and families, from any division into Christians and
non-Christians, nor does he seem to notice that the system
of the Church apart could only produce spiritual pride,
hypocrisy and all the errors of subjectivism in those singled
out by the Spirit, to say nothing of the obstinacy and
wantonness engendered in those who were excluded.</p>

<p>The popular Church, of which it was necessary to make the
best, owing to the impracticability of the Church apart,
apparently embraced all, yet, within it, according to Luther,
the true believers formed an invisible Church, and this in
a twofold manner, first, because they were themselves not
to be recognised, and, secondly, because the Word and
the Sacrament, from which they derived their religious life,
concealed a whole treasure of invisible forces.</p>

<p>With such imperfect elements it was, however, impossible
to establish a new Church system. A new phase was
imminent, towards which everything was gravitating of its
own accord; this was the State Church, i.e. the national
Church as a State institution, with the sovereign at its head.
The various congregational churches formed a visible body
frequently impinging on the outward, civil government, and
largely dependent on the support of the authorities; hence
their gradual evolution into a State Church. The local and
national character of the new system paved the way for this
development. Luther, whilst at the bottom of his heart
anxious to check it&mdash;for his ideal was an independent
Church&mdash;came, under pressure of circumstances, to champion
it as the best and only thing. A popular Church
or State Church had never been his object, yet he ultimately
welcomed the State Church as the best way to meet difficulties;
this we shall see more clearly further on. In his
efforts to overcome the apathy of the masses he even had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
recourse to compulsion by the State, inviting the authorities
to force resisters to attend Divine Worship.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Luther should have asked himself whether the moral
grandeur and strength which, in spite of its favourable
appearance, the congregational Church lacked, would be
found in the compulsory State Church. This question he
should have been able to answer in the negative. It was a
radical misfortune that in all the attempts made to infuse
life into the branch torn away by Luther from the universal
Catholic Church the secular power never failed to interfere.
The State had stood sponsor to the new faith on its first
appearance and, whether in Luther’s interest or in its own,
the State continued to intervene in matters pertaining to
the Church. This interweaving of politics with religion
failed to insure to the new Church the friendly assistance
of the State, but soon brought it into a position of entire
subservience&mdash;in spite of the protests of the originator of the
innovation.</p>

<p>The jurisdiction of the State within the “Church,” in the
case of the early Lutheran congregations, did not amount to
any actual government of the Church by the sovereign.
This, in the appalling form it was to assume, was a result of
the later Consistories. What, with Luther’s consent, first
passed into the hands of the secular authorities was the
jurisdiction in certain external matters which, according
to the earlier Canon Law, really belonged to the Bishop’s
court. When episcopal authority was abolished the Elector
of Saxony assumed this jurisdiction as a sort of bishop
<i>faute-de-mieux</i>, or, to use Melanchthon’s expression, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
principal member of the Church (“<i>membrum præcipuum
ecclesiæ</i>”).<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The jurisdiction in question concerned, above
all, matrimonial cases which, according to Luther, belonged
altogether to the secular courts, matters of tithes, certain
offences against ecclesiastical or secular law and points of
Church discipline affecting public order. Luther had
declared that the Church possessed no power to govern,
that the only object for which it existed was to make men
pious by means of the Word, that the secular authority was
the only one able to make laws and formally to claim
obedience “whether it does right or wrong.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Hence
the State in assuming jurisdiction in the above matters was
doing nobody any injustice, was merely exercising its right,
whilst the authority of which it made use was not “ecclesiastical,”
but merely the common law exercised for the
purpose of preserving “sound doctrine” and the “true
Church.”<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The next step was the appointment of ecclesiastical superintendents
by the sovereign and, either through these or
without them, the nomination of pastors by the State, the
removal of unqualified teachers, the convening of ecclesiastical
synods or “consultations,” the carrying out of
Visitations and the drawing up of Church regulations. Here
again no objection on the point of principle was raised by
Luther, partly because the power of the keys, according to
him, included no coercive authority, partly because the
idea of the “<i>membrum præcipuum ecclesiæ</i>” was elastic
enough to permit of such encroachments on the part of the
ruler.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> In the Protestant Canon Law, compiled by R. Sohm,
all the above is described, under appeal to Luther, as coming
under the jurisdiction of the State, the Church being “without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
jurisdiction in the legal sense” and its business being
“merely the ministry of the Word.”<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The introduction of the Consistories in 1539 was a result
of the idea expressed by Justus Jonas in his memorandum,
viz. that if the Church possesses no legal power of coercion
for the maintenance of order, she is fatally doomed to
perish. To many the growing corruption made an imitation
of “episcopal jurisdiction in the Catholic style,” such as
Melanchthon desiderated, appear a real need.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> In the event
the advice of Jonas was followed, jurisdiction being conferred
on the Consistories directly by the ruler of the land.
After a little hesitation Luther gave his sanction to the new
institution, seeing that, though appointed by the sovereign,
it was a mere spiritual tribunal of the Church. The Consistories,
more particularly after his death, though retaining
the name of ecclesiastical courts gradually became a department
of the civil judicature, a good expression of the
complete subservience of Church to State.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The setting up of the civil government of the Church was
achieved,” remarks Sohm, by an arrangement really “in entire
opposition to the ideas of the Reformation.”<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>“The lack of system in Luther’s mode of thought is perhaps
nowhere so apparent as in his views on the authorities and their
demeanour towards religion.”<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The want of unity and sequence
in his teaching becomes even more apparent when we listen to
the very diverse opinions of Protestant scholars on the subject.
It is no fault of the historian’s if the picture presented by the
statements of Luther and his commentators shows very blurred
outlines.</p>

<p>“The civil government of the Church,” writes Heinrich
Böhmer, in “Luther im Lichte der neueren Forschung”&mdash;speaking
from his own standpoint&mdash;“in so far as it actually
represents a ‘government,’ is utterly at variance with Luther’s
own principles in matters of religion. Neither can it be brought
into direct historical connection with the Reformation....
The so-called congregational principle is really the only one
which agrees with Luther’s religious ideal, according to which
the decision upon all ecclesiastical matters is to be regarded as
the right of each individual congregation.... It is, however,
perfectly true that the attempts to reorganise the ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
constitution on the basis of this idea were a complete failure.
Neither at Wittenberg, nor at Allstedt, nor at Orlamünde were
the communities from a moral point of view sufficiently ripe.”<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The civil government of the Church is also in disagreement
with Luther’s conception of the secular power as expressed in
some chief passages of his work “Von welltlicher Uberkeytt,”
(1523). According to Erich Brandenburg’s concise summary,
Luther shows in this work, that “the task of the State and of
society is entirely secular; it is not their duty to make men
pious. There is no such thing as a Christian State; society and
the State were called into being by God on account of the wicked.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
Brandenburg also quotes later statements made by Luther
concerning the secular authorities, and infers, “that neither the
civil government of the Church in the sense accepted at a later
date, nor the quasi-episcopate of the sovereign, is really compatible
with such views.”<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>It is true that in his Commentary on the Gospel of St. John
(1537-1538), in his annoyance at his unfortunate experiences of
State encroachments, Luther declares, that “the two governments
should not be intermingled to the end of the world, as
was the case with the Jewish nation in Old Testament times, but
must remain divided and apart, in order that the pure Gospel
and the true faith may be preserved, for the Kingdom of Christ
and the secular government are two very different things.”<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
He realises, however, the futility of his exhortations: “You
will see that the devil will mingle them together again ... the
sword of the Spirit and the secular sword.... Our squires, the
nobles and the Princes, who now go about equipped with authority
and desire to teach the preachers what they are to preach and to
force the people to the sacrament according to their pleasure,
will cause us much injury; for it is necessary ‘to render obedience
to the worldly authorities,’ hence ‘what we wish, that you must
do,’ and thus the secular and spiritual government becomes a
single establishment.”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Brandenburg, for his part, is of opinion that “the civil government
of the Church had come about in opposition to Luther’s
wishes, but had to be endured like other forms of injustice....
Luther reproached himself with strengthening the tyrants by his
preaching, with throwing open doors and windows to them.
But with the unworldly idealism peculiar to him, he thereupon
replied defiantly: ‘What do I care? If, on account of the
tyrants, we are to omit the teaching which is so essential a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
matter, then we should have been forced long since to relinquish
the whole Evangel.’”<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand another Protestant theologian, H. Hermelink,
who supports the opposite view, viz. that Luther was a staunch
upholder of the supremacy of the authorities in matters ecclesiastic,
adduces plentiful quotations from Luther’s writings in
which the latter, even from the early days of his struggle, declares
that the authorities have their say in spiritual matters, that it is
their duty to provide for uniformity of teaching in each locality
and to supervise Christian worship. He admits, however, that
Luther set certain “bounds to the ecclesiastical rights of the
authorities.”<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>These statements in favour of the authorities cannot be disallowed.
They arose partly from Luther’s efforts to advance his
party with the help of the worldly magnates, partly, as will
appear immediately, from the material difficulties of the Lutheran
congregations, due to the confiscation of Church property by the
secular power.</p>

<p>In any case it was unexpectedly that Luther found himself
confronted with all the above problems. When their immediate
solution became the most urgent task for the new faith, Luther’s
principles were still far from presenting any well-defined line of
action. “To these, and similar questions,” remarks Wilhelm
Maurenbrecher, the Protestant historian of the Reformation,
“Luther had given no sufficient answer; it would even seem as
though he had not considered them at all carefully.” Among
the questions was, according to Maurenbrecher, the fundamental
one: “Who is to decide whether this or that person
belongs to the congregation?” If the congregation, where does
the Church come in? for, “after all, the congregation is not the
Church.”<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The very idea of the Church had still to be determined.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p></div>


<h4><i>Confiscation of Church Property.</i></h4>

<p>In the Saxon Electorate, the home of the religious innovation,
it had become imperatively necessary that the parishes
which sided with Luther should be set in order by a strong
hand, first, and principally, in the matter of the use to which
the Church lands were to be put. In these territories, where
the civil government of the Church first obtained, it arose
through the robbing and plundering of the churches.</p>

<p>“The parsonages all over the country lie desolate,” Luther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
wrote to the Elector Johann of Saxony on October 31, 1525,
“no one gives anything, or pays anything.... The
common people pay no attention to either preacher or
parson, so that unless some bold step be taken and the
pastors and preachers receive State aid from your Electoral
Highness, there will shortly be neither parsonages, nor
schools, nor scholars, so that the Word of God and His
worship will perish. Your Electoral Highness must therefore
continue to devote yourself to God’s service and act as
His faithful tool.”<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Not long afterwards Luther strongly advises the Elector
not only to see to the material condition of the parsonages,
but also to examine by means of visitors the fitness of the
parsons for their office, “in order that the people may be well
served in the Evangel and may contribute to his [the
parson’s] support.”<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>The Order for Visitations (1527), which Luther looked
over and which practically had his approval, was intended
in the first place to better financially the condition of the
parishes. Hand in hand with this, however, went supervision
of the preaching by the State and the repression by
force of whatever Catholic elements still survived.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The
Electoral Visitors here and there found the utmost indifference
towards the new faith prevailing among the people,
whose interests were all material. They finally proposed
that the Elector should provide for the support of the
parsons and assume the right of appointing and removing
all the clergy.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Luther himself had written as early as 1526: “The complaints
of the parsons almost everywhere are beyond measure
great. The peasants refuse to give anything at all, and there is
such ingratitude amongst the people for the Holy Word of God
that there can be no doubt a great judgment of God is imminent....
It is the fault of the authorities that the young receive no
education and that the land is filled with wild, dissolute folk, so
that not only God’s command but our common distress compel
us to take some measures.”<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>“Common distress” was, in point of fact, compelling recourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to the authorities who had confiscated the property of the Church;
i.e. the heads of the various parishes or the Electoral Court.
The magistrates had laid hands upon the smaller benefices,
which, as a matter of fact, were for the most part in their own
gift or in that of the families of distinction, whilst in case of
dispute the Elector himself had intervened. The best of the
plunder naturally went to the Ruler of the land.</p>

<p>Luther addressed the Elector as follows: “Now that an end
has been made of the Papal and ecclesiastical tyranny throughout
your Highness’s dominions, and now that all the religious houses
and endowments have come into the power of your Electoral
Highness as the supreme head, this involves the duty and burden
of setting this matter in order, since no one else has taken it up,
nor has a right to do so.”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>&mdash;Nor was Luther backward in pointing
out to the Court, when obliged to complain of the meagre support
accorded to the churches, the great service he had done in enriching
it: “Has the Prince ever suffered any loss through us?”
he asks a person of influence with the Elector in 1520. “Have
we not, on the contrary, brought him much gain? Can it be
considered an insignificant matter, that not only your souls have
been saved by the Evangel, but that also considerable wealth,
in the shape of property, has begun to flow into the Prince’s
coffers, a source of revenue which is still daily on the increase?”<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>The appropriation of property by the Elector as Ruler of the
land necessarily entailed far-reaching obligations with regard to
the churches.</p>

<p>Hence, when, on November 22, 1526, Luther represented to
the sovereign the financial distress of the pastors, he also told
him, that a just ruler ought to prevail upon his subjects to
support the schools, pulpits and parsonages.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Johann, in his reply,
when agreeing to intervene for the better ordering of the churches,
likewise appeals to his rights as sovereign of the country:
“Because we judge, and are of opinion, that it beseems us as
Ruler to attend to them.”<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Luther’s invitation to the Princes to effect by force a reformation
of the ecclesiastical order had already thrown wide open the
doors to princely aggression.</p>

<p>“The secular power,” Luther had said, “has become a member
of the Christian body, and though its work is of the body, yet it
belongs to the spiritual estate. Therefore its work shall go
forward without let or hindrance amongst all the members of the
whole body.” The Christian secular authority shall exercise its
office in all freedom, if necessary even against Pope, bishop and
priest, for ecclesiastical law is nothing but a fond invention of
Roman presumption.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>If it was the duty of the rulers to intervene on behalf of the
general public needs of Christendom, how much more were they
bound to provide for the proper standing and pure doctrine of
the pastors. It is they who must assist in bringing about a
“real, free Council,” since the Pope, whose duty it was to convene
it, neglected to do so; “this no one can do so effectively as the
secular powers, particularly now that they have become fellow-Christians,
fellow-priests and fellow-clergymen, sharing our
power in all things; their office and work, which they have
from God over all men, must be allowed free course wherever
needful and wholesome.”<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Luther was wide-awake to the fact, and reckoned upon it,
that the gain to be derived from the rich ecclesiastical
property would act as a powerful incentive with those in
power to induce them to open their lands to the innovations.
What ruler would not be tempted by the prospect of
coming so easily into possession of the Church’s wealth,
that fabulous patrimony accumulated from the gifts
previous ages had made on behalf of the poor, of the service
of the altar, of the clergy and the churches? They heard
Luther declare that he was going to tear Catholic hearts
away from “monasteries and clerical mummery”; they
also heard him add: “When they are gone and the churches
and convents lie desolate and forsaken, then the rulers of
the land may do with them what they please. What care
we for wood and stone if once we have captured the hearts?”<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
The taking over of the Church property by the rulers was,
according to him, simply the just and natural result of the
preaching of the Evangel. This was the light in which he
wished the very unspiritual procedure of confiscation to be
regarded.</p>

<p>He frequently insisted very urgently that the nobles and
unauthorised laymen were not to seize upon the church
buildings, revenues and real property. He was aware of the
danger of countenancing private interference, and preferred
to see the expropriation carried out by the power of the
State and according to law. In this wise he hoped that the
property seized might still, to some extent, be employed in
accordance with its original purpose, though, as was inevitable,
he was greatly disappointed in this hope. It is spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
property, he repeats frequently, bestowed for a spiritual purpose,
and therefore, even after the departure of its former occupant,
it must be used for the salvation of souls in accordance
with the Evangel. To the Elector Johann, for instance, he
writes: The parsonages must be repaired out of the revenues
of the monasteries, “because such property cannot profit
your Electoral Highness’s Exchequer, for it was dedicated
to God’s service and therefore must be devoted primarily
to this object. Whatever is left after this, your Electoral
Highness may make use of for the needs of the land, or for
the poor.”<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>His demands were, however, very inadequately complied
with. If Luther really anticipated their fulfilment, he was
certainly very ignorant of the ways of the world. Who was
to prevent the Princes from seizing upon the Church lands
with greedy hands so soon as they stood vacant, and employing
them for their own purposes, or to enrich the nobles?
Even where everything was done in an orderly manner, who
could prevent ever-impecunious Sovereigns from making
use of the revenues for State purposes and from allotting
the first place among the “needs of the land” of which we
just heard Luther speak, to their own everyday requirements?</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Luther’s subsequent experiences drew from him such words
as the following: “This robbing of the monasteries”&mdash;he wrote
to Spalatin, who was still connected with the Court of the new
Elector Johann (since 1525), concerning the condition of things in
the Saxon Electorate&mdash;“is a very serious matter, which worries
me greatly. I have set my face against it for a long while past.
Not content with this, when the Prince was stopping here I
actually forced my way into his chamber, in spite of the resistance
I met with, in order to make representations to him privately.”
He goes on to complain that there was little hope of redress so
long as certain selfish intrigues were being carried on in the
vicinity of the sovereign. Indeed, he does not anticipate much
help from this Elector Johann, because he lacks his father’s
firmness, and is much too ready to listen to anyone. “A Prince
must know how to be angry, a King must be something of a
tyrant; this the world demands.” As things are, however, we
are imposed upon in all sorts of ways for “the sake of the spoils”;
“smoke, fumes and fables” are made to serve, and we do not
even know who are at work behind the scenes; at any rate they are
hostile to the Evangel and were its foes even in the time of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
pious Elector. “Now that they have enriched themselves, they
laugh and exult over the fact that it is possible in the name of
the Evangel to enjoy all sorts of evangelical freedom, and at the
same time to be the Evangel’s worst enemy. This is bitter to me,
more bitter than gall.” “I shall have to issue a public admonition
to the Prince in order to insist upon some other administration
of the religious houses; perhaps then I shall be able to shame
those fellows.... I hate Satan’s rage, malice and ambushes,
everywhere, in all matters, and unceasingly, and it gives me
pleasure to thwart him and injure him wherever I can.”<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Thus the consequences were more serious than the ex-monk
in his ignorance of the ways of the world had anticipated.
“Satan,” on whose shoulders he lays the blame, was not to be
so easily expelled. The worst acts of violence perpetrated in
the name of the Word of God were the result of the lust for
wealth which he had unchained.</p>

<p>“How heavily the negligence of our Court presses upon me,”
he sighs in the last years of his life. Much is undertaken presumptuously,
and then, after a while, we are left stranded in the
mire; they do nothing themselves, and we are left to our fate.
But I intend to pour my grievous complaints into the ears of
Dr. Pontanus and the Prince himself as soon as I get a chance.
I have learnt, to my great annoyance, that the nobles are governing
in the Prince’s name.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">A few days after the letter to Spalatin, quoted above, in
another letter to him, he gives vent to his thoughts on the
marriage questions arising within the domain of the new faith.</p>


<h4><i>Secularisation of the Matrimonial Courts.<br />
Against the Lawyers.</i></h4>

<p>The secularisation of the marriage courts appears as a
very characteristic subject amongst the questions of jurisdiction
arising between State and Church, side by side with
the secularisation of Church property. The secularising
of these courts was the logical consequence of Luther’s
secularising of matrimony, which he regarded&mdash;to forestall
his later statements<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>&mdash;“as an outward, secular matter,
subject to the authorities, like food and clothing, house and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
land.”<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> According to the Confession of Augsburg at the very
most it was a sacrament only in the same way that the
authority of the magistrates appointed by God was a
sacrament.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The codicil to the Articles of Schmalkalden
required, that the “magistrates shall establish special
marriage courts,” because Canon Law “contains pitfalls
for conscience.”<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>As the Church had formerly been the sole authority on
questions relating to marriage, and as the custom of referring
such matters to her was deeply rooted in the life of
the German people, Luther at the outset consented to take
this into account and to leave the decision to his preachers;
the result of this was, however, that he found himself overwhelmed
amidst his other labours by a mass of unpleasant
and uncongenial work and was accordingly soon moved to
throw the whole burden on the State and the secular
lawyers, though here again he met with distressing experiences.</p>

<p>He wrote to Spalatin in 1527: “We have been plagued
by so many questions concerning marriage, owing to the
connivance of the devil, that we have decided to leave this
profane business to the profane courts. Formerly I was
stupid enough to expect from mankind something more
than mere humanity, and to fancy that they could be
directed by the Evangel. Now, facts have shown that they
despise the Evangel and insist on being compelled by the
law and the sword.” He shows himself very much annoyed
in this letter at the position taken up by the jurists with
their “law” concerning those marriages which took place
contrary to the will of the parents. The lawyers of the
Wittenberg Faculty agreed with the older Church in
recognising the validity of such unions. Luther, on the
other hand, ostensibly on biblical grounds, wished them to
be held as null, because duty to the public and the respect
due to parents required it. In practice, however, he soon
became aware how precarious was this position. “The
Gospel teaches,” he explains to Spalatin, “that the father
must be ready to give his consent when his son asks what is
lawful, and that the son must obey his father; on both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
sides there must be good-will; this holds good with the
pious. But when godless parents hear that the Gospel
confirms their authority, they become tyrannical [and
refuse to consent to their children’s marriage]. The children,
on the other hand, learn that, according to the law of Pope
and Emperor, they have the necessary permission, and so
they abuse this liberty and despise their parents. Both
sides are in the wrong and numerous examples of the same
abound.”<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>In the case of such dissensions between parents and
children, he says in an instruction to Spalatin which was
printed later, the son “must be sent to the profane, i.e.
Imperial Courts of Justice, under which we live in the flesh,
and thus you will be relieved of the burden.” Preachers,
according to him, as “evangelists,” have nothing to do with
legal questions, but merely with peaceable matters; “where
there is strife and dissension the Kaiser’s tribunal [the
secular courts] must decide.... Should the son get no
redress from the secular court, then there is nothing for him
but to submit to his father’s tyranny.”<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Naturally neither Luther nor the parties concerned found
much satisfaction in such expedients. The handing over of
the marriage questions to the State was to prove a source of
endless and increasing trouble and vexation to Luther in the
ensuing years, particularly in connection with the “secret”
marriages just referred to. Luther even appealed from the
then practice of the lawyers to the law of the old Roman
Empire, which exaggerated the paternal rights to the extent
of making the children’s marriages altogether dependent on
the will of the parents. In the letter to Spalatin, printed in
the Wittenberg edition of Luther’s German works, we find
the following marginal note which expresses Luther’s
opinion: “The old Imperial and Christian laws decree and
ordain that children shall marry with the knowledge, consent
and advice of their parents, and this the natural law also
teaches. But the Pope, like the tyrant and Antichrist he
is, has determined to be the only judge in questions of
marriage and has abolished the obedience due by children
to their parents.”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The truth is, that Canon Law, whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
strongly urging both sons and daughters to obey and respect
their parents, nevertheless recognised as valid a marriage
contract when concluded under conditions otherwise lawful,
and this because it saw no reason for depriving the contracting
parties of the freedom which was theirs by the natural law.</p>

<p>Luther, greatly incensed by the opposition of the lawyers,
at length, in a sermon preached in 1544, launched forth the
most solemn condemnation possible of the so-called secret
unions contracted without the paternal consent. He
declared: “I, Dr. Martinus, command in the name of the
Lord our God, that no one shall enter into a secret engagement
and then, after the event, seek the parents’ ratification
... and, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
I condemn to the abyss of hell all those who assist in furthering
such devil’s work as secret engagements. Amen.”<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>In the same way he boasted to the Elector, that the
jurists had “wanted to play havoc” with his churches
“with their annoying, damnable suits which, however, I
have resolved to expel from my churches as damnable and
accursed to-day and for all eternity.” The principal motive
for his action was the “Divine command” he had received
“to preach the observance of the Fourth Commandment in
these matters.”<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>What Luther, however, was most sensitive to was that
some of the Wittenberg lawyers, conformably with the
traditional code, declared the marriages of priests, and
consequently his own, to be invalid in law, and the children
of such unions to be incapable of inheriting. He keenly
felt the blow which was thus directed against himself and
his children. His displeasure he gave vent to in some
drastic utterances. If what the lawyers say is correct,
he continues in the writing above referred to addressed to
the Elector, “then I should also be obliged to forsake the
Evangel and crawl back into the frock [the religious habit]
in the devil’s name, by power and virtue of both ecclesiastical
and secular law. Then Your Electoral Highness would have
to have my head chopped off, dealing likewise with all those
who have married nuns, as the Emperor Jovian decreed
more than a thousand years ago” [and as the law still stood
in the codes then in use].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Thoughts such as these, on the reprobation of his union
with Bora by the law of the Church and of the Christian
Roman Empire, stood in glaring contrast to the pleasant
moods of domestic life to which he so gladly gave himself up.
He sought to find solace from his public cares and conflicts
in his family circle, and some compensation for the troubles
which the great ones of the earth caused him in the domestic
delights in which he would have wished all other fallen
priests to share. He succeeded, to an extent which appeared
by no means enviable to those who followed a different ideal,
in forgetting his priestly state and its demands. In one of
the letters just mentioned he writes as a father to Spalatin,
who also had had recourse to marriage: “May you live
happily in the Lord with your rib [i.e. your wife]. My little
Hans sends you greetings; he is now in the month of teething
and is beginning to lisp; it is delightful to see how he
will leave no one in peace about him. My Katey also sends
you her best wishes, above all for a little Spalatin, to teach
you what she boasts of having learnt from her little Hans,
i.e. the crown and joy of wedded life, which the Pope and his
world were not worthy of.”<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>What Canon Law said of the high calling of the priest and
religious and of the depth of the fall of those who proved
untrue to it, no longer made the slightest impression on him.
It would have been in vain had a St. Jerome of olden days,
a mediæval St. Bernard or a Geiler of Kaysersberg championed
the cause of Canon Law against Luther and his nun
in the glowing language they knew so well how to use.
Luther’s own words quoted above concerning the death
penalty decreed by Jovian the Christian Emperor against
anyone sacrilegiously violating a nun, illuminate as with a
lightning flash the antagonism between antiquity and
Luther’s doings.</p>

<p>He asserts himself proudly because he considers his
heavenly calling to expound the new Evangel, and his
Divine mission, had been questioned by the lawyers
who represented the authority of the State. When, in
defiance of their objections against the legitimacy of his
family, he drafted his celebrated will, he was careful to
inform them that, for its validity, he has no need of them
or of a notary; he was “Dr. Martinus Luther, God’s Notary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and Witness to His Gospel,” and was “well known in
heaven, on earth and in hell”; that “God had entrusted
him with the Gospel of His Dear Son and had made him
faithful and true to it,” for which reason, “in spite of the
fury of all the devils,” many “in the world regarded him as
a teacher of truth.”<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<h3>3. The Question of the Religious War; Luther’s Vacillating
Attitude. The League of Schmalkalden, 1531</h3>

<p>After the Diet of Augsburg, Luther, as we have shown
(vol. ii., pp. 391, 395 f.), proclaimed the war of religion much
more openly than ever before. His writings, “Auff das
vermeint Keiserlich Edict” and “Widder den Meuchler zu
Dresen,” bear witness to this. The proceedings taken by
the Empire on the ground of the resolutions of Worms, and
the attitude of the Catholic Princes and Estates, appeared
to him merely a plot, a shameful artifice on the part of the
“bloodhounds” who opposed him.</p>

<p>In his writing against the Assassin, i.e. Duke George of
Saxony, he expounds his politico-religious standpoint in a
way which became his rule for the future. Cain and Abel, the
devil and the righteous, stand face to face. “The world
belongs either to the devil or to the Children of God. The
devil’s realm conceals a murderer and bloodhound, Abel,
a pious and peaceable heart.” Abel stands for the Lutherans,
Cain and the devil for the Papists. It is a “veracious
opinion, founded on Scripture and proved by the fruits of
the Papists, that they are ever on the watch and lie in wait
day and night to destroy us and root us out.”<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> “If the
Emperor or the authorities purpose to make war on God
[i.e. Luther’s Evangel], then no one must obey them.” In
this case everyone must resist, for it is no “disobedience,
rebellion or contumacy to refuse to obey and assist in
shedding innocent blood.”<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Opposition and violent resistance to the lawful authority
of the empire and its legitimate action is here justified by the
argument that to fight for the Evangel is no revolt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The defiant resolve to proceed to any extreme regardless
of others or of the public weal, finds its strongest expression
in Luther’s words during and after the Diet of Augsburg:
“Not one hair’s breadth will I yield to the foe,” he wrote
from the fortress of Coburg, with a hint at the wavering
attitude of Melanchthon and Jonas. This it was which led
up to the statement already quoted: “If war is to come,
let it come.” “God has delivered them up to be
slaughtered.”<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<h4><i>Luther on Armed Resistance, until 1530.</i></h4>

<p>If we glance at Luther’s former attitude towards open
resistance, we find that it would be unjust to say that he
preferred religious war to peaceful propaganda. He perceived
the danger which it involved. At an earlier period
he several times had occasion to intervene when warring
elements threatened to estrange the German Princes. We
find statements of his where he speaks against armed
resistance and points out (to use his later words) what a
“blot upon our teaching” a “breach or disturbance of the
peace of the land would be.”<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> There is no question that such
utterances preponderate with him until 1530. From the
very first years of his public career he was anxious to impress
on all, particularly on his own Sovereign, that the Word
alone must work all; he eliminates as far as possible every
prospect of a struggle with the Emperor or the other rulers,
which was what the Elector really dreaded. He also
frequently expounds theoretically, more particularly in his
booklet “Von welltlicher Uberkeytt” (1523), the duty of
Christians not to resist the authorities, because the Kingdom
of God means yielding, humility and submission; every
true believer must even allow himself to be “fleeced and
oppressed”; he must indeed confess the evangelical faith,
but be willing to “suffer” under an authority hostile to the
faith (cp. vol. ii., p. 229 f.). When occasion offered he was
ready to quote numerous passages from Holy Scripture in
order to show that violent revolt and armed intervention
on behalf of the Gospel are forbidden, and that the German
Princes had nothing to fear from him in this regard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>None the less, his enterprise was visibly drifting towards
the employment of force and towards war.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">How deeply he felt the premonition of civil war is plain, for
instance, from the following:</p>

<p>“There will be no lack of breaches of the peace, and of war
only too much,” he wrote in 1528 to the Elector Johann.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> He
and Melanchthon together also wrote in the same strain to the
Crown-Prince of Saxony, Johann Frederick, in 1528; “Time
will bring enough fighting with it which it will be impossible to
avoid, so that we should be grateful to accept peace where we
are able.”<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> As early as 1522 he had given to the Elector Frederick
one of his reasons for leaving the Wartburg and returning to
Wittenberg: “I am much afraid and troubled because I am,
alas, convinced that there will be a great revolt in the German
lands, by which God will chastise the nation.” The Evangel was
well received by the common people, but some were desirous of
extinguishing the light by force. And yet “not only the spiritual,
but also the secular power, must yield to the Evangel, whether
cheerfully or otherwise, as all the accounts contained in the
Bible sufficiently show.... I am only concerned lest the revolt
should begin with the Lords, and, like a national calamity, engulf
the priesthood.”<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless he is determined to be of good cheer; even
should the war ensue, his conscience is “pure, guiltless and
untroubled, whereas the consciences of the Papists are guilty,
anxious and unclean.” “Therefore let things take their course
and do their worst, whether it be war or rebellion according as
God’s anger decrees.”<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>This gives redoubled weight to his determination to press
forward relentlessly. “Let justice prevail even though the
whole world should be reduced to ruin. For I say throw peace
into the nethermost hell if it is to be purchased at the price of
harm to the Evangel and to the faith.”<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>It has been admitted on the Protestant side that “Luther
adhered to this view throughout his life, viz.: that his doctrine
must be preached even though it should lead to the destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of all.”<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> In confirmation of this, another passage taken from
Luther’s writings is quoted: “It has been said that if the Pope
falls Germany will perish, be utterly wrecked and ruined; but
how can I help that? I cannot save it; whose fault is it? Ah,
they say, if Luther had not come and preached, the Papacy
would still be on its legs and we should be at peace. I cannot
help that.”<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>When the same author urges in Luther’s defence that, “he
was not really indifferent to the evil consequences of his actions
in ecclesiastical and political matters,”<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> we naturally ask whether
the author of the schism did not at times feel bitterly his heavy
responsibility for these results, and whether he should not have
exerted himself in every possible way to ward off the “evil
consequences.” His own admissions, to be given elsewhere
(see vol. v., xxxii.), concerning his inward struggles, disclose how
frequently he was troubled with such reproaches and what
difficulty he had in ridding himself of them.</p>

<p>To the inflammatory invitations already given we may subjoin
a few others.</p>

<p>“It were better,” Luther says in his Church-postils, “that all
the churches and foundations throughout the land were uprooted
and burnt to powder&mdash;and the sin would be less even
though done out of mere wantonness&mdash;than that a single soul
should be seduced and corrupted by this [Papistical] error.”<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
And, further on: “Here you see why the lightning commonly
strikes the churches rather than any other buildings, viz.:
because God is more hostile to them than to any others, because
in no den of robbers, no house of ill-fame is there such sin, such
blasphemy against God, such murder of the soul and destruction
of the Church committed as in these houses” [i.e. in the churches
where the Catholic worship obtained].<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Elsewhere, at an
earlier date he had said: “Would it be astonishing if the Princes,
the nobles and the laity were to hit Pope, bishop, priest and
monk on the head and drive them out of the land? It has never
before been heard of in Christendom, and it is abominable to
hear now, that the Christian people should openly be commanded
to deny the truth.”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>&mdash;Besides these, we have the fiery
words he flung among the people: “Where the ecclesiastical
Estate does not proceed in the way of faith and charity [according
to the Evangel], my wish is not merely that my doctrine
should interfere with the monasteries and foundations, but that
they were reduced to one great heap of ashes.”<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>&mdash;In fine: “A
grand destruction of all the monasteries and foundations would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
be the best reformation, for they are of no earthly use to Christendom
and might well be spared.... What is useless and unnecessary
and yet does such untold mischief, and to boot is
beyond reformation, had much better be exterminated.”<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The
word here rendered as “destruction” is one of which Luther
frequently makes use to denote violent annihilation, for instance,
of the devastation of Jerusalem and its Temple, nor can we well
explain it away in the above connection; he certainly never
pictured to himself the “grand destruction of all the monasteries
and foundations” otherwise than as a general reduction to ruins.
The excuse brought forward in modern times in extenuation of
Luther is a very strange one, viz.: that, when giving vent to
such expressions, he frequently added the qualifying clause “<i>if</i>
the Catholics do not change their opinions,” then violence will
befall them; hence only in the event of their final refusal to
accept the new teaching was the destruction so vividly described
to overtake them! Presumably his contemporaries should have
shown themselves grateful for this saving clause. The mitigation
conveyed by the clause in question in reality amounted to this:
Only if the whole world becomes Lutheran will it be saved from
destruction.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>It is psychologically worth noticing that Luther, in his zeal,
seems never to have perceived that the argument might just as
well be turned against himself. The Emperor and the Catholic
powers of the Empire, with at least as much show of reason,
might have urged as he did, that no power, without being doomed
to “destruction” and to being “burnt to ashes,” could stand
against the Gospel. The Gospel which they defended was that
handed down by the Church, whereas Luther’s Evangel, to
mention only one point, was novel and hitherto unheard of by
theologians and faithful laity alike. On the one occasion when this
thought occurred to him, he had the following excuse ready:
We are sure of our faith, hence we may and must demand that
everything yield to it; the Emperor and his party on the other
hand have no such assurance and can never reach it. “We
know that the Emperor is not and cannot be certain of it, because
we know that he errs and seeks to oppose the Evangel. We are
not obliged to believe that he is certain because he does not act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
in accordance with God’s Word, whereas we on the other hand
do; for it is his bounden duty to recognise God’s Word!”
Otherwise, Luther adds, “every murderer and adulterer might
also plead: ‘I am right, therefore you must approve my act
because I am certain I am in the right.’”<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>&mdash;“It was with arguments
like these that the Protestant Estates were to justify
their overthrow of the ancient faith and worship, and to demonstrate
the wickedness of the Emperor’s efforts to preserve the
faith and worship of his fathers.”<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Of the various memoranda which Luther had to draw up
for his Sovereign on the question of armed resistance, that
of February 8, 1523, prepared for the Elector Frederick,
must be mentioned first.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> In this the Prince’s attention is
drawn to the fact, that publicly he had hitherto preserved
an attitude of neutrality concerning religious questions, and
had merely given out that, as a layman, he was waiting for
the triumph of the truth. Hence it was necessary that he
should declare himself for the justice of Luther’s cause if
he intended to abandon his attitude of submission to the
Imperial authority. In that case he might have recourse
to arms in the character of a stranger who comes to the
rescue, but not as a sovereign of the Empire. Further, “he
must do this only at the call of a singular spirit and faith,
short of which he must give way to the sword of the higher
power and die with his Christians.”<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Should he, however, be
attacked, not by the Emperor, but by the Catholic Princes,
then, after first attempting to bring about peace, he must
repel force by force.</p>

<p>When, in 1528, the false reports were circulated, of which
we hear in the history of the Pack negotiation, to wit, that
the Catholic Princes of the Empire were on the point of falling
upon the Protesters, Luther sent a letter to Johann, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Elector, regarding the question of law. What was to be
done if the Catholic powers, without the authorisation of
the Emperor, attacked the Lutheran party? Luther’s
verdict was that such an act on the part of “scoundrel-princes”
must be resisted by force of arms “as a real
revolt and conspiracy against the Empire and His Imperial
Majesty,” but that “to take the offensive and anticipate
such an action on the part of the Princes was in no wise to
be counselled.”<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>On this occasion he manifested serious apprehension of
the mischief which might be caused by a precipitate armed
attack on the part of his princely patrons. It was a very
different matter to look forward to a mere possibility of war
and to find himself directly confronted with an outbreak of
hostilities. “May God preserve us from such a horror!
This would indeed be to fish with a draw-net and to take
might for right. No greater blame could attach to the
Evangel, for this would be no Peasant Rising but a Rising
of the Princes, which would destroy Germany utterly to the
joy of Satan.”<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>The above memorandum had dealt with the question of
an attack by the Princes of the Empire. But what was to be
done if the Emperor himself intervened?</p>

<p>The Lutheran Princes and Estates were anxious to
exercise the utmost caution and restraint with regard to
the Emperor personally, and in this Luther agreed with
them. At Spires, in 1526, they had decided to behave “in
such a way as to be able to answer for it before God and the
Emperor,” which, however, did not prevent them from
establishing the “evangelical” worship in contravention of
the decrees of Worms. It was hoped that the Emperor,
hampered by his foreign policy, would not take up arms.
When, accordingly, the protesting Princes, at the time of
the Pack business, commenced warlike preparations against
the Catholic party in the Empire, they solemnly declared at
Rotach, in June, 1528, that they “excepted” the Emperor.
In the same way they desired that their action at Spires in
1529, where they “protested” against the Emperor, should
be looked upon as an appeal to the Emperor “better instructed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>”
When the Emperor, on account of the protest,
began to take a serious view of the matter, any scruples
which the sovereigns of Hesse and the Saxon Electorate
may have felt concerning the employment of armed resistance
against him soon evaporated. In Saxony it was held
that a closer alliance of the Princes favourable to the innovations
ought not to be “shorn of its meaning and value” by
this “exemption of the Emperor”; the exemption, it was
argued, was only of the person of the Emperor, not of his
mandataries. A Saxon memorandum at the end of July,
1529, practically made an end of the exemption; “resistance,
even to the Emperor, the most dangerous of our foes,
belongs to the natural law of humanity.”<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> This was the
opinion of the Margrave of Brandenburg, and even more
so of the Landgrave of Hesse. At Nuremberg, however,
Lazarus Spengler sought to persuade the Council to negative
this resolution; he was still entirely under the influence of
Luther’s earlier teaching, that the spirit must be ready to
endure and suffer under the secular authorities.</p>

<p>Luther, in spite of his frequent threats and urgings, was
not immediately to be induced to make common cause with
the politicians. In January, 1530, Johann Brenz penned a
memorandum in which, in terms of the utmost decision, he
denies the lawfulness of resisting the Emperor, whereas on
Christmas Day, 1529, in a similar memorandum requested of
him by the Elector, Luther expresses himself most ambiguously.
He, indeed, just hints at the unlawfulness of such
resistance, but qualifies this admission by such words as the
following: “There must be no resistance unless actual
violence is done, or dire necessity compels”; “without a
Council and without a hearing” there must be no war
against the Emperor; before this, however, much water is
likely to flow under the bridge, and God may easily find
means of establishing peace; “hence my opinion is that
the project of taking the field should be abandoned for the
nonce, unless further cause or necessity should arise.”<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>In a letter to George, Margrave of Brandenburg, written
on March 6, 1530, with the object of winning him over to
the war party, Philip of Hesse declared that he had seen
“in Luther’s own writings to the Elector, that he sanctioned
the latter’s resisting the Emperor.” This probably refers
to the above memorandum which lies to-day in the Hessian
archives at Marburg, the original of which seems to have
been submitted to Philip; it may, however, have been some
other letter since lost, or possibly the 1528 memorandum
in which Luther speaks of the lawfulness of repelling the
anticipated attack of the Catholic Princes.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>To take up arms in the cause of the Evangel was certainly
not in accordance with Luther’s previous teaching, however
much he may himself have occasionally disregarded it.
Owing to a certain mystical confidence in his cause, he
could not bring himself to believe that things would ever
come to be settled by force of arms. The Elector Johann,
unlike Philip of Hesse, again began to hesitate. On January
27, 1530, he instructed the Wittenberg Faculty to let him
have, within three weeks, the views of its lawyers. These
counsellors declared in favour of the lawfulness of such a
war against the Emperor, basing their view on two considerations,
viz. that as an appeal had been made to a Council the
Emperor could not in the meantime insist upon submission
in matters of religion, and that, on his election at Frankfurt,
it had been agreed that all the Princes and Estates should
retain their customary rights. In spite of this, the lawyers
consulted were not in favour of having forthwith recourse to
open resistance, but suggested the exercise of patience and
restraint.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Luther and Melanchthon replied only on March
6, 1530. What strikes one in Luther’s reply is that “he
has nothing personal to say on the relations between
Emperor and Prince; this was a serious omission. All
he sees is the individual Christian&mdash;in this case the sovereign&mdash;and
his fidelity to the faith.... He is still unable to
believe in a coming disaster, for this his God will surely not
permit.”<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>His categorical declaration, in the memorandum of March
30, 1530, against the lawfulness of resistance, is of greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
importance, for it is the last of the kind. After this the
change already foreseen was to take place.</p>

<p>With an express appeal to his three advisers, Jonas,
Bugenhagen and Melanchthon, Luther explains to the
Elector,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> that armed resistance “can in no way be reconciled
with Scripture.” Quite candidly he lays stress on the unfavourable
prospects of resistance and the evil consequences
which must attend success. Having taken the step, we
should, he says, “be forced to go further, to drive away the
Emperor and make ourselves Emperor.” “In the confusion
and tumult which would ensue everyone would want
to be Emperor, and what horrible bloodshed and misery
would that not cause.”<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>In principle, it will be observed, the letter left open a
loophole in the event of a more favourable condition of the
Protestant cause supervening, i.e. should it be possible to
arrive at the desired result by some quieter and safer means,
and without deposing the Emperor. None the less noteworthy
are, however, the biblical utterances to which
Luther again returns: “A Christian ought to be ready to
suffer violence and injustice, more particularly from his own
ruler,” otherwise “there would be no authority or obedience
left in the world.” He would fain uphold, against all law,
“whether secular or Popish,” the truth, that “authority is
of Divine institution.” Hence the Princes must quietly
submit to all the Emperor does; “Each one must answer
for himself and maintain his belief at the risk of life and limb,
and not drag the Princes with him into danger.” “The
matter must be committed to God.” Hence the memorandum
culminates in the exhortation to sacrifice “life and
limb,” i.e. to endure martyrdom.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> This memorandum of
Luther’s was kept secret. At any rate the apparently
heroic renunciation of all recourse to arms, together with the
reference&mdash;reminiscent of his earlier mysticism&mdash;to the
Christian’s vocation to suffer violence and injustice, make
of this memorandum a remarkable document not to be
matched by any other writing of Luther at that time.
Though there is little doubt that the sight of the comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
helpless and critical position of the new party
had its effect here, yet, beyond this, there is a psychological
connection between the standpoint voiced in the memorandum
and Luther’s attitude after the inward change which
occurred in him whilst yet a monk. His perfectly just
injunction not to withstand the Emperor, he rests partly on
the mystic theories he had imbibed at that time, partly on
his early erroneous views concerning the rights of the
authorities as guardians of outward, public order. In his
enthusiasm for his cause he clings to that presumptuous
confidence in a special Divine guidance, which had inspired
him from the beginning of his career. “The call of a
singular spirit and faith,” which he considered necessary in
the case of the Elector Frederick (see above, p. 48), he
hears quite clearly within himself, though as yet this call
does not urge him to advocate armed resistance to the
Emperor, but merely inspires him blindly to confide in
his cause and to exhort others to “martyrdom.”</p>

<p>Simultaneously Melanchthon sent to the Elector a memorandum
of his own, which, apart from being clearer in
language and thought, closely resembles Luther’s and
betrays the same deficiencies.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<h4><i>The Change of 1530; Influence of the Courts.</i></h4>

<p>In that same year, 1530, after his return to Wittenberg
from the Coburg on the termination of the Diet of Augsburg,
a notable change took place in Luther’s public attitude
towards the question of the employment of force. This
change we can follow step by step.</p>

<p>The fact that the lawyers attached to the Court had, in
view of the circumstances, altered their minds, weighed
strongly with Luther. Confronted with the measures of
retaliation announced by the Diet, and more hopeful regarding
the prospects of resistance now that the Protesters were
joining forces, the councillors of the Saxon Electorate, with
Chancellor Brück at their head, were inclined to the opinion
that whatever sentences the Reichsgericht might pronounce
in virtue of the Imperial edict of Augsburg might safely be
disregarded, which, of course, was tantamount to a commencement
of resistance. They were very anxious concerning
the consequences of the decrees of Augsburg, as these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
involved the restitution of all the property and rights of the
Church, which had been appropriated by the secular power
in the name of religion. Johann, Elector of Saxony, for a
while continued to regard resistance as unlawful. On
reaching Nuremberg, on his return journey from Augsburg,
he said to Luther’s friend there, Wenceslaus Link: “Should
one of my neighbours, or anyone else, attack me on account
of the Evangel, I should resist him with all the force at my
command, but should the Emperor come and attack me, he
is my liege lord and I must yield to him, and what were more
honourable than to be exterminated on account of the Word
of God?”<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Gradually, however, he was brought over to
the new standpoint of his councillors. The example of the
Landgrave of Hesse, who belonged to the war party and
was very hopeful of the results of a league, had great weight
with him, and likewise his determination not to surrender
to the executors of the Imperial edict the Church property
which had been confiscated. The innovations which, in the
beginning, had seemed a work of high-minded idealists, were
now pushed forward by many of the Princes, for motives of
the very lowest, viz. to avoid making restitution of property
which had been unlawfully distrained. On unevangelical
motives such as these it was that the theory of submission to
the secular power, in particular to the Emperor, announced
by Luther in such grandiloquent language, was to suffer
shipwreck.</p>

<p>Philip of Hesse, who was aware of the weak points in
Luther’s previous declarations on the subject, was the first
to attempt to bring about a change in his views.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">He entered into communication with Luther in October, 1530,
and sent him a “writing,” together with a “Christian admonition,”
to encourage him and his theologians, in whom, during
the Diet, he thought he had detected a certain tendency to waver.
Luther replied, on October 15, in a very devout letter, assuring
the Landgrave that he had “received both the writing and the
admonition with pleasure and gladness.” “I beg to thank
Your Highness for your good and earnest counsel”; he and his,
as time went on, were “even less disposed to yield” and reckoned
on the help of God.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Philip, in his next letter a week later, came at once to the
crucial point, the question of resistance. He reminded Luther
of the memorandum in which he had said, they must indeed not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
“commence the war, but that if they were attacked they might
defend themselves” (p. 50 f.). Philip, without further ado,
explains his plans against the Emperor. The Emperor, he says
with perfect frankness, “took the oath to his Princes at his election,
just as much as they did to him.... Hence, if the Emperor
does not keep his oath to us, he reduces himself to the rank of
any other man, and must no longer be regarded as a real Emperor,
but as a mere breaker of the peace.” The “most important of
the Electors and Estates” had not agreed to the Reichstagsabschied.
Hence there was hope of triumphing over the
Emperor. In his letter to Luther, he even makes use of comparisons
from the Bible, just as Luther himself was in the habit of
doing, and this he did again at a later date when seeking Luther’s
sanction for his bigamy. “God in the Old Testament did not
forsake His people or allow the country to perish which trusted
in Him.” He had come to the aid of the Bohemians and of
“many other too, against Emperors and such-like, who treated
their subjects with unjust violence.” This being so, he requests
Luther for his “advice and opinion” whether force may not be
used, seeing that “His Majesty is determined to re-establish the
devil’s doctrine.”<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>Luther now saw himself obliged openly to avow his standpoint,
all the more as a similar request had reached him from the
Elector, in this case possibly a verbal one. He left the Landgrave
to wait and replied first to the Elector, though only by word of
mouth, so as not to commit himself irretrievably on so delicate a
matter. What his reply exactly was is not known. At the end
of October he had to go to Torgau for a conference on the subject
with the Elector’s legal advisers and possibly those of other
Princes. Melanchthon and Jonas accompanied him, and the
negotiations were protracted and lively.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>During these negotiations Luther replied from Torgau, on
October 28, to the letter from the Landgrave referred to above,
though in general and evasive terms. He says, he hopes no
blood will be shed, but, in the event of things going so far, he had
told the Elector his opinion on resistance, and of this the Landgrave
would hear in due season; that it would be dangerous for
him, as an ecclesiastic, to put this into writing, for many reasons.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
Hence for the nonce he was determined to express himself only
verbally on this tiresome question.</p>

<p>In what direction his thoughts were then turning may be
gathered from what he says to the Landgrave in the same letter
concerning his writings; the latter had asked him, he says, for
a controversial booklet, “as a consolation for the weak”; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>intended “in any case to publish a booklet shortly ... admonishing
all consciences, that no subject was bound to render
obedience should His Imperial Majesty persist”; and in which
he will prove that the Emperor’s demands are “blasphemous,
murderous and diabolical”&mdash;still, the booklet was not to be
termed “seditious.” He here is referring either to the “Auff das
vermeint Edict” or to the “Warnunge.” We have already
spoken of the revolutionary character of the language he used
in these tracts published in the early part of 1531, and, subsequently,
in the reply “Widder den Meuchler zu Dresen.”<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> What
he was there to advocate goes far beyond the limits of mere
passive resistance.</p></div>

<p class="p1">He was at first unwilling to declare his views at Torgau.
Not to contradict what he had previously said, he protested
that the question did not concern him, since, as a theologian,
his business was to teach Christ only. As regards secular
matters, he could only counsel compliance with the law and,
on the matter of forcible resistance to the Emperor, that any
action taken should be conformable to the “written laws.”
“But what these laws were he neither knew nor cared.”<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>The assembled lawyers were, however, loath to leave
Torgau without having reached an understanding, and submitted
another statement to Luther and his colleagues,
requesting their opinion on it. In this document they had
sought to prove, from sources almost exclusively canonical,
that it was lawful to resist the Emperor by force, because
“he proceeds and acts contrary to law,” not being a judge
in matters of religion, and that, even if he were such a judge,
he had no right to do anything on account of the appeal to a
Council. They urged that it was necessary to “obey God and
evangelical truth rather than men,” and that the Emperor
was “no more than a private individual so far as the ‘cognition’
and ‘statution’ of this matter went ... nor does the
‘execution’ come within his province.” For the sake of the
salvation of souls the Emperor was not to be regarded as
“judge in the matter of our faith,” for his “injustice is
undeniable, manifest, patent and notorious, yea, more than
notorious.”<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>The councillors chose to deal with the matter chiefly from
the point of view of canon law, as is shown by their misquotations
from such well-known canonists as Panormitanus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Innocent IV., Felinus, Baldus de Ubaldis and the Archidiaconus
(Baisius).<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> In spite of this they calmly assumed
the truth of the proposition, condemned in canon law, of
the subordination of Pope to Council and of the right of
appealing from Pope to Council. They took it for granted
that Luther’s doctrines had not yet been finally rejected by
the Church, and, in contradiction with actual fact, declared
that the Augsburg Reichstagsabschied “admitted and
allowed” that Luther’s doctrines, seeing that they were
supposed to have been condemned by previous Councils,
should come up for discussion at the next. As a matter of
fact the Reichstagsabschied contained nothing of the sort
“concerning doctrines of faith.”<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>This document was submitted to the theologians before
they left Torgau, and their embarrassment was reflected in
their written reply. Luther agreed with his friends that the
only way out of the difficulty was to put the whole thing on
the shoulders of the lawyers. He and his party declared
that they stood altogether outside the question, since the
councillors had already decided independently of them in
favour of armed resistance, on the ground of the secular,
Imperial laws. As for the reasons alleged from canon law,
he refused to take them into consideration. Later on he was
glad to be able to appeal to this subterfuge, and declared
that he “had given no counsel.”<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>At this time, however, Luther, Melanchthon and Jonas
put their signatures to a memorandum in which they sought
to protect themselves by certain assurances which make a
painful impression on the reader.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">It was true that hitherto they had taught, so they say, “that
the [secular] authorities must on no account be resisted,”
but, they had been unaware “that the authorities’ own laws,
which we have always taught must be diligently obeyed, sanctioned
this.” They had also taught, “that the secular laws
must be allowed to take their own course, because the Gospel
teaches nothing against the worldly law.” “Accordingly, now
that the doctors and experts in the law have proved that our
present case is such that it is lawful to resist the authorities, we,
for our part, ‘cannot disprove this from Scripture, when self-defence
is called for, even though it should be against the Emperor
himself.’” They then come to the question of arming. This they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
declare to be distinctly practical and advisable, especially as
“any day other causes may arise where it would be essential to
be ready to defend oneself, not merely from worldly motives,
but from duty and constraint of conscience.” It was necessary
“to be ready to encounter a power which might suddenly
arise.”<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>The Landgrave of Hesse was then making great preparations
for war, with an eye on Würtemberg, where, as he admitted
publicly, he wished forcibly to re-instate Duke Ulrich, a friend to
the religious innovations.</p>

<p>The theologians of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, unlike
those of Wittenberg, were opposed to resistance. They replied
then, or somewhat later, concerning the views put forward by
the lawyers, that it was a question of the supreme secular Majesty,
not of a judge who was subservient to a higher secular sword,
hence that the lawyers’ suppositions could not stand.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Little
heed was however paid to their objection. On the other hand
the proposal made by the legal consulters, that further representations
should be made to the Emperor regarding the execution
of the Reichstagsabschied, was described by the theologians as
“not expedient,” though it might be further discussed at the
Nuremberg Conference on November 11 (Martinmas).<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Instead, it was for November 13 that a summons, dispatched
by Saxony on October 31, invited a conference to
meet at Nuremberg to discuss the matter, and take the
steps which eventually led to the formation of the defensive
League of Schmalkalden. At first it was proposed, that, after
the Nuremberg conference, another should be held at Schmalkalden
on November 28, though as a matter of fact the only
meeting held commenced at Schmalkalden on December 22.</p>

<p>Only now did it become apparent that Luther and his
theologians had, at least in the opinion of the Saxon
politicians, expressed themselves privately much more
openly in favour of resistance than would appear from the
above memorandum. The envoys from the Saxon Electorate
appealed with great emphasis to the opinion of the Wittenberg
divines, in order to show the lawfulness of the plan
of armed resistance and the expediency of the proposed
League. Armed with this authority they openly “defied
our ministers,” wrote Lazarus Spengler of Nuremberg, to
Veit Dietrich on February 20, 1531. Spengler, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Nuremberg Councillors and those of Brandenburg, was
opposed to resistance and to the League. He was surprised
that “Dr. Martin should so contradict himself.”<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> The fact
is that he was the only person to whom Luther’s previous
memorandum of March, 1530, had been communicated.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>The Nuremberg magistrates appealed, among other
reasons, to the clear testimony of Scripture which did not
sanction such proceedings against the supreme secular
authority. They feared the consequences of a religious war
for Germany, just as Luther himself had formerly done, but,
in spite of their adherence to the new faith, they were more
frank and courageous in their effort to avert it than he on
whose shoulders the chief responsibility in the war was to
rest.</p>

<p>One sentence of Melanchthon’s, written in those eventful
days, singularly misrepresents the true position of affairs.
To his friend Camerarius, on January 1, 1531, he says: “We
discountenance all arming.”<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Melanchthon also writes: “We are now consulted less
frequently than heretofore as to the lawfulness of resistance,”
and he repeats much the same thing on February 15,
1531: “On the matter of the League no one now questions
either Luther or myself.”<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> If we can here detect a faint note
of wonder and regret, we may assuredly ask whether the
very behaviour of the theologians at Torgau was not the
reason of their advice being at a discount; their dissimulation
and ambiguity were not of a nature to inspire the
lawyers and statesmen with much respect.</p>

<p>It was some time before this vacillation in official, written
statements came to an end. Some more instances of it are
to be met with in the epistolary communications between
Luther and the town of Nuremberg, which was opposed to
the Schmalkalden tendencies.</p>

<p>Prior to November 20, 1530, the Elector of Saxony had
addressed himself to the magistrates of Nuremberg with the
request that “they would make preparations for resisting
the unjust and violent measures of the Emperor.” Of this
Veit Dietrich informed Luther from Nuremberg on that day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
adding that the Elector had made a reference to an approval
of the measures of defence secured from his “Councillors
and Doctors,” but had said nothing of the theologians.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
News was, however, subsequently received in Nuremberg
that the Saxon envoys present at Schmalkalden had boasted
of the support of Luther and his friends.</p>

<p>It was in consequence of this that the Nuremberg preacher,
Wenceslaus Link, enquired of Luther in the beginning of
January, 1531, or possibly earlier, whether the news which
had reached Nuremberg by letter was true, viz. that “they
had expressed the opinion that resistance might be employed
against the Emperor.”</p>

<p>Without delay, on January 15, Luther assured him: “We
have by no means given such a counsel” (“<i>nullo modo
consuluimus</i>”).<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">By way of further explanation he adds: “When some said
openly that it was not necessary to consult the theologians at
all, or to trouble about them, and that the matter concerned
only the lawyers who had decided in favour of its lawfulness, I
for my part declared: I view the matter as a theologian, but if
the lawyers can prove its permissibility from their laws, I see no
reason why they should not use their laws; that is altogether
their business. If the Emperor by virtue of his laws determines
the permissibility of resistance in such a case, then let him bear
the consequences of his law; I, however, pronounce no opinion
or judgment on this law, but I stick to my theology.” It is thus
that he expresses himself concerning the argument which the
lawyers had, as a matter of fact, drawn almost exclusively from
canon law, the texts of which they misread.</p>

<p>He then puts forward his own theory in favour of the belligerent
nobles of his party, according to which a ruler, when he acts as a
politician, is not acting as a Christian (“<i>non agit ut christianus</i>”), as
though his conscience as a sovereign could be kept distinct from
his conscience as a Christian. “A Christian is neither Prince nor
commoner nor anything whatever in the personal world. Hence
whether resistance is permissible to a ruler as ruler, let them
settle according to their own judgment and conscience. To a
Christian nothing [of that sort] is lawful, for he is dead to the
world.”</p>

<p>“The explanations [Luther’s] have proceeded thus far,” he
concludes this strange justification, “and this much you may
tell Lazarus [Spengler, the clerk to the Nuremberg Council]
concerning my views. I see clearly, however, that, even should
we oppose their project, they are nevertheless resolved to offer
resistance and not to draw back, so full are they of their own
ideas; I preach in vain that God will come to our assistance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and that no resistance will be required. God’s help is indeed
visible in this, that the Diet has led to no result, and that our
foes have hitherto taken no steps. God will continue to afford
us His help; but not everyone has faith. I console myself with
this thought: since the Princes are determined not to accept our
advice, they sin less, and act with greater interior assurance, by
proceeding in accordance with the secular law, than were they
to act altogether against their conscience and directly contrary
to Holy Scripture. It is true they do not wit that they are acting
contrary to Scripture, though they are not transgressing the civil
law. Therefore I let them have their way, I am not concerned.”</p>

<p>He thus disclaimed all responsibility, and he did so with all the
more confidence by reason of his sermons to the people, where
he continued to speak as before of the love of peace which
actuated him, ever with the words on his lips: “By the Word
alone.” “Christ,” he exclaims, “will not suffer us to hurt Pope
or rebel by so much as a hair.”<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>It was easy to foresee that after such replies from Luther,
Spengler and the magistrates of Nuremberg would not be pleased
with him. Possibly Link had doubts about making known at
Nuremberg a writing which was more in the nature of an excuse
than a reply, since, on such a burning question which involved
the future of Germany, a more reliable decision might reasonably
have been looked for. On February 20, fresh enquiries and
complaints concerning the news which had come to Nuremberg
of Luther’s approval of organised resistance, reached Veit
Dietrich, from the Council clerk, Spengler, and were duly transmitted
to Luther (see above, p. 58 f.). Luther now thought it
advisable, on account of the charge of having retracted his
previous opinion, to justify himself to Spengler and the magistrates.
In his written reply of February 15, he assured the clerk,
that he “was not conscious of such a retractation.” For, to the
antecedent, he still adhered as before, viz. that it was necessary
to obey the Emperor and to keep his laws. As for the conclusion,
that the Emperor decrees that in such a case he may be resisted,
this, he says, “was an inference of the jurists, not of our own;
should they bring forward a proof in support of this conclusion&mdash;which
as yet they have not done&mdash;(‘<i>probationem exspectamus,
quam non videmus</i>’)&mdash;we shall be forced to admit that the
Emperor has renounced his rights in favour of a political and
Imperial law which supersedes the natural law.” Of the Divine
law and of the Bible teaching, which Luther had formerly advocated
with so much warmth, we find here no mention.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>The scruples of the magistrates of Nuremberg were naturally
not set at rest by such answers, but continued as strong as ever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
After the League had already been entered into, an unknown
Nuremberg councillor of Lutheran sympathies, wrote again to
the highest theological authority in Wittenberg for information
as to its legality. In his reply Luther again threw off all responsibility,
referring him, even more categorically than before, to the
politicians: “They must take it upon their own conscience and
see whether they are in the right.... If they have right on
their side, then the League is well justified.” Personally he preferred
to refrain from pronouncing any opinion, and this on
religious grounds, because such leagues were frequently entered
into “in reliance on human aid,” and had also been censured by
the Prophets of the Old Covenant. Had he chosen, the distinguished
Nuremberger might have taken these words as equivalent
to a doubt as to the moral character of the League of Schmalkalden.
Furthermore, Luther adds: “A good undertaking and
a righteous one” must, in order to succeed, rely on God rather
than on men. “What is undertaken in real confidence in God,
ends well, even though it should be mistaken and sinful,” and
the contrary likewise holds good; for God is jealous of His
honour even in our acts.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">The citizens of Nuremberg had, in the meantime, on
February 19, sent to the Saxon envoys their written refusal
to join the League of Schmalkalden. The magistrates
therein declared that they were still convinced (as Luther
had been formerly) that resistance to the Emperor was
forbidden by Holy Writ, and that the reasons to the contrary
advanced by the learned men of Saxony were insufficient.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
George, Elector of the Franconian part of Brandenburg,
who was otherwise one of the most zealous supporters of the
innovations, also refused to join the League.</p>

<p>The memorandum in which Luther, Jonas, Bugenhagen
and Melanchthon had declared, in March, 1530, that the
employment of force in defence of the Gospel “could not in
any way be reconciled with Scripture” (above, p. 51 f.) was
kept a secret. Not even Melanchthon himself was permitted
to send it to his friend Camerarius, though he
promised to show it him on a visit.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Myconius, however,
sent it from Gotha confidentially to Lang at Erfurt, on
September 19, 1530, and wrote at the same time: “I am
sending you the opinion of Luther and Philip, but on
condition that you show it to no one. For it is not good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
that Satan’s cohorts should be informed of all the secrets
of Christ; besides, there are some amongst us too weak to
be able to relish such solid food.”<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>In spite of these precautions copies of the “counsel”
came into circulation. The text reached Cochlæus, who
forthwith, in 1531, had it printed as a document throwing
a timely light on the belligerent League entered into at
Schmalkalden in that year. He subjoined a severe, running
criticism, a reply by Paul Bachmann, Abbot of the monastery
of Altenzell, and other writings.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Cochlæus pointed out, that it was not the Emperor but Luther,
who had been a persecutor of the Gospel for more than twelve
years. Should, however, the Emperor persecute the true Gospel
of Christ, then the exhortation contained in Luther’s memorandum
patiently to allow things to take their course and even to suffer
martyrdom, would be altogether inadmissible, because there
existed plenty means of obtaining redress; in such a case
God was certainly more to be obeyed than the Emperor; any
Prince who should assist the Emperor in such an event must be
looked upon as a tyrant and ravening wolf; it was, on the contrary,
the duty of the Princes to risk life and limb should the
Gospel and true faith of their subjects be menaced; and in the
same way the towns and all their burghers must offer resistance;
this would be no revolt, seeing that the Imperial authority would
be tyrannously destroying the historic ecclesiastical order as
handed down, in fact, the Divine order. Luther’s desire, Cochlæus
writes, that each one should answer for himself to the Emperor,
was unreasonable and quite impossible for the unlearned. Finally,
he warmly invites the doctors of the new faith to return to
Mother Church.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>The author of the other reply to Luther’s secret memorandum
dealt more severely with it. Abbot Bachmann declares, that it
was not inspired by charity but by the cunning and malice of the
old serpent. “As long as Luther had a free hand to carry on his
heresies unopposed, he raged like a madman, called the Pope
Antichrist, the Emperor a bogey, the Princes fools, tyrants and
jackanapes, worse even than the Turks; but, now that he foresees
opposition, the old serpent turns round and faces his tail,
simulating a false humility, patience and reverence for the
authorities, and says: ‘A Christian must be ready to endure
violence from his rulers!’ Yet even this assertion is not true
always and everywhere....” Should a ruler really persecute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the Divine teaching, then it would be necessary to defend oneself
against him. “I should have had to write quite a big book,” he
concludes, “had I wished to reply one by one to all the sophistries
which Luther accumulates in this his counsel.”<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p></div>


<h4><i>The League of Schmalkalden and the Religious Peace of
Nuremberg.</i></h4>

<p>The League of Schmalkalden was first drawn up and
subscribed to by Johann, Elector of Saxony, and Ernest,
Duke of Brunswick, on February 27, 1531. The other
members affixed their signatures to the document at
Schmalkalden on March 29. The League comprised, in
addition to the Electorate of Saxony and the Duchy of
Brunswick-Lüneburg, the Landgraviate of Hesse under
Philip, the prime mover of the undertaking, and was also
subscribed to by Prince Wolfgang of Anhalt, Counts Gebhard
and Albert of Mansfeld, and the townships of Strasburg,
Ulm, Constance, Reutlingen, Memmingen, Lindau, Biberach,
Isny, Lübeck, Magdeburg and Bremen.</p>

<p>A wedge had been driven into the unity of Germany at
the expense of her internal strength and external development.
What had been initiated at Gotha in 1526 by the
armed coalition between Landgrave Philip of Hesse and the
Elector of Saxony, in the interests of the religious innovations,
was now consummated.</p>

<p>The obligation to which the members of the League of
Schmalkalden pledged themselves by oath was as follows:
“That where one party is attacked or suffers violence for
the Word of God or for causes arising from it, or on any
other pretext, each one shall treat the matter in no other
way than as though he himself were attacked, and shall
therefore, without even waiting for the others, come to the
assistance of the party suffering violence, and succour him
to the utmost of his power.” The alliance, which was first
concluded for six years, was repeatedly renewed later and
strengthened by the accession of new members.</p>

<p>Luther, for his part, had now arrived at the goal whither
his steps had been tending and towards which so many of
the statements contained in his letters and writings had
pointed, inspired as they were by a fiery prepossession in
favour of his cause. It suited him admirably, that, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
iron which had so long been heating came upon the anvil,
he should remain in the background, leaving to the lawyers
the first place and the duty of tendering opinions. In his
eyes, however, the future success of the League, in view of
its then weakness, was still very doubtful. Should the
Schmalkalden conference turn out to be the commencement
of a period of misfortune for the innovations, still, thanks
to the restraint which Luther had imposed on himself, in
spite of his being the moving spirit and the religious link
between the allies, his preaching of the Evangel would be
less compromised. The miseries of the Peasant War, which
had been laid to his account, the excesses of the Anabaptists
against public order, the unpopularity which he had earned
for himself everywhere on account of the revolts and disturbance
of the peace, were all of a nature to make him
more cautious. There are many things to show, that,
instead of promoting the outbreak of hostilities in the days
immediately subsequent to the Diet of Augsburg, he would
very gladly have contented himself with the assurance,
that, for the present, the Reichstagsabschied not being
capable of execution, things might as well take their course.
By this policy he would gain time; he was also anxious for
the new faith quietly to win new ground, so as to demonstrate
to the Emperor by positive proofs the futility of any proceedings
against himself.</p>

<p>The wavering attitude of many of the Catholic Estates
at Augsburg had inspired him with great hopes of securing
new allies. It there became apparent that either much had
been rotten for a long time past in that party of the Diet
which hitherto had been faithful to the Pope, or that the
example of the Protesters had proved infectious.</p>

<p>Wider prospects were also opening out for Lutheranism.
In Würtemberg Catholicism was menaced by the machinations
of the Landgrave of Hesse. There seemed a chance of
the towns of Southern Germany being won back from
Zwinglian influences and making common cause with
Wittenberg. Henry the Eighth’s failure in his divorce
proceedings also raised the hopes of the friends of the new
worship that England, too, might be torn away from the
Papal cause. At the conclusion of the Diet, Bugenhagen
had been summoned by the magistrates of Lübeck in order
to introduce the new Church system in that city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>In Bavaria there was danger lest the jealousy of the
Dukes at the growth of the house of Habsburg, and their
opposition to the expected election of Ferdinand as King,
should help in the spread of schism.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that Luther’s letter to Ludwig Senfl, the
eminent and not unfriendly musician and composer, bandmaster
to Duke William and a great favourite at the Court
of Bavaria, should have been sent just at this time. To
him Luther was high in his praise of the Court: Since the
Dukes of Bavaria were so devoted to music, he must extol
them, and give them the preference over all other Princes,
for friends of music must necessarily possess a good seed of
virtue in their soul. This connection with Senfl he continued
in an indirect fashion.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>The best answer to the resolutions passed at Augsburg
seemed to the first leader of the movement to lie in expansion,
i.e. in great conquests, to be achieved in spite of all threats
of violence.</p>

<p>Instead of having recourse to violence, the Empire, however,
entered into those negotiations which were ultimately
to lead, in 1532, to the so-called Religious Peace of Nuremberg.
At about this time Luther sent a missive to his
Elector in which his readiness for a religious war is perfectly
plain.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">The document, which was composed jointly with the other
Wittenberg theologians, and for the Latinity of which Melanchthon
may have been responsible, treats, it would appear, of certain
Imperial demands for concessions made at the Court of the
Elector on September 1, 1531, previous to the Schmalkalden conference.
These demands manifest the utmost readiness on the
part of the authorities of the Empire to make advances. Yet
Luther in his reply refuses to acquiesce even in the proposal that
people everywhere should be allowed to receive the Sacrament
under one kind, according to the ritual hitherto in use. We are
bound to declare openly and at all times, he says, that all those
who refrain from receiving under both kinds are guilty of sin.
He continues, referring to the other points under debate:
It is true that we are told of the terrible consequences which
must result should “war and rebellion break out, the collapse of
all public order fall like a scourge upon Germany, and the Turks
and other foreign powers subjugate the divided nation. To this
our reply is: Sooner let the world perish than have peace at the
expense of the Evangel. We know our teaching is certain; not
a hair’s breadth may we yield for the sake of the public peace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
We must commend ourselves to God, Who has hitherto protected
His Church during the most terrible wars, and Who has
helped us beyond all expectation.”<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>This argument based on the Evangel cuts away the ground
from under all Luther’s previous more moderate counsels.</p></div>

<p class="p1">The religious peace of Nuremberg was in the end more
favourable to him than he could have anticipated. To
his dudgeon, however, he had to remain idle while the
guidance of the movement was assumed almost entirely by
the League of Schmalkalden, the fact that the League was a
military one supplying a pretext for dispossessing him more
and more of its direction. Already, in 1530, he had been
forced to look on while Philip made advances to the sectaries
of Zürich and the other Zwinglian towns of Switzerland, and
concluded a treaty with them on November 16 for mutual
armed assistance in the event of an attack on account of
the faith. “This will lead to a great war,” he wrote to the
Elector, “and, as your Electoral Highness well knows, in
such a war we shall be defending the error concerning the
Sacrament, which will thus become our own; from this may
Christ, my Lord, preserve your Electoral Highness.”<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>His apprehensions, lest the good repute of his cause
should be damaged by unjust bloodshed, grew, when, in
1534, the warlike Landgrave set out for Würtemberg.</p>

<p>It was a crying piece of injustice and violence when Philip
of Hesse, after having allied himself with France, by means
of a lucky campaign, robbed King Ferdinand of Würtemberg
and established the new faith in that country by
reinstating the Lutheran Duke Ulrich.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Before the campaign Luther had declared that it was
“contrary to the Gospel,” and would “bring a stain upon
our teaching,” and that “it was wrong to disturb or
violate the peace of the commonwealth.”<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> He hinted at
the same time that he did not believe in a successful issue:
“No wise man,” he said subsequently, “would have risked
it.”<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>&mdash;Yet, when the whole country was in the hands of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
conqueror, when a treaty of peace had been signed in which
the articles on religion were purposely framed in obscure and
ambiguous terms, while the prospects of the new faith,
in view of Ulrich’s character, seemed excellent, Luther
expressed his joy and congratulations to the Hessian Court
through Justus Menius, a preacher of influence: “We
rejoice that the Landgrave has returned happily after having
secured peace. It is plain that this is God’s work; contrary
to the general expectation He has set our fears to rest! He
Who has begun the work will also bring it to a close. Amen.”<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Luther himself tells us later what foreign power it was
that had rendered this civil war in the very heart of Germany
possible. “Before he [the Landgrave] reinstated the Duke
of Würtemberg he was in France with the King, who lent
him 200,000 coronati to carry on the war.”<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>The fear of an impending great war between the religious
parties in Germany was gradually dispelled. The object of
the members of the League of Schmalkalden in seeking
assistance from France and England was to strengthen their
position against a possible attack on the part of the Emperor;
at the same time, by refusing to lend any assistance against
the Turks, they rendered him powerless.</p>

<p>Luther now ventured to prophesy an era of peace. We
shall have peace, he said, and there is no need to fear a war
on account of religion. “But questions will arise concerning
the bishoprics and the foundations,” as the Emperor is
trying to get the rich bishoprics into his hands, and the
other Princes likewise; “this will lead to quarrels and
blows, for others also want their share.”<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> This confirms the
observation made above: In place of a religious struggle
the Princes preferred to wrangle over ecclesiastical property
and rights, of which they were jealous. Thus Luther’s
prediction concerning the character of the struggle in the
years previous to the Schmalkalden and Thirty Years’ War
was not so far wrong.</p>

<h4><i>Luther and the Religious War in Later Years.</i></h4>

<p>Luther was never afterwards to revert to his original
disapproval of armed resistance to the Emperor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">In his private conversations we frequently find, on the contrary,
frank admissions quite in agreement with the above remark on
“war and rebellion” being justified by the Divine and indestructible
Evangel. It is not only lawful, he says, but necessary
to fight against the Emperor in the cause of the Evangel. “Should
he begin a war against our religion, our worship and our Church,
then he is a tyrant. Of this there is no question. Is it not lawful
to fight in defence of piety? Even nature demands that we should
take up arms in defence of our children and our families. Indeed,
I shall, if possible, address a writing to the whole world exhorting
all to the defence of their people.”<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>Other similar statements are met with in his Table-Talk at a
later date. “It is true a preacher ought not to fight in his own
defence, for which reason I do not take a sword with me when I
mount the pulpit, but only on journeys.”<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> “The lawyers,” he
said, on February 7, 1538, “command us to resist the Emperor,
simply desiring that a madman should be deprived of his sword....
The natural law requires that if one member injure another
he be put under restraint, made a prisoner and kept in custody.
But from the point of view of theology, there are doubts (Matt.
v., 1 Peter ii.). I reply, however, that statecraft permits, nay
commands, self-defence, so that whoever does not defend himself
is regarded as his own murderer,” in spite of the fact, that, as a
Christian and “believer in the Kingdom of Christ, he must
suffer all things, and may not in this guise either eat or drink or
beget children.” In many cases it is necessary to put away
“the <i>Christianum</i> and bring to the fore the <i>politicam personam</i>,”<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
just as a man may slay incontinently the violator of his wife.
“We are fighting, not against Saul, but against Absalom.”
Besides, the Emperor might not draw the sword without the
consent of the Seven Electors. “The sword belongs to us, and
only at our request may he use it.”<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> “Without the seven he has
no power; indeed, if even one is not for him, his power is nil and
he is no longer monarch.... I do not deprive the Emperor of
the sword, but the Pope, who has no business to lord it and act
as a tyrant.”<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> “The Emperor will not commence a war on his
own account but for the sake of the Pope, whose vassal he has
become; he is only desirous of defending the abominations of
the Pope, who hates the Gospel and thinks of nothing but his own
godless power.”<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>Luther, in his anger against the Papists and the priests, goes
so far as to place them on a par with the Turks and to advise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
their being slaughtered;<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> this he did, for instance, in May, 1540.
In 1539 he says: “Were I the Landgrave, I should set about it,
and either perish or else slay them because they refuse peace in a
good and just cause; but as a preacher it does not beseem me
to counsel this, much less to do it myself.”<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> The Papal
Legate, Paolo Vergerio, when with Luther in 1535, expressed
to him his deep indignation at the deeds of King Henry VIII. of
England, who had put to death Cardinal John Fisher and Sir
Thomas More. Luther wrote to Melanchthon of Vergerio’s
wrath and his threats against the King, but shared his feelings
so little as actually to say: “Would that there were a few more
such kings of England to put to death these cardinals, popes
and legates, these traitors, thieves, robbers, nay, devils incarnate.”
Such as they, he says, plunder and rob the churches and are
worse than a hundred men of the stamp of Verres or a thousand
of that of Dionysius. “How is it that Princes and lords,
who are always complaining to us of the injury done to the
churches, endure it?”<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Even in official memoranda Luther soon threw all discretion
to the winds, and ventured to speak most strongly in
favour of armed resistance.</p>

<p>Such was the memorandum, of January, 1539, addressed
to the Elector Johann Frederick and signed at Weimar by
Jonas, Bucer and Melanchthon, as well as Luther. The
Elector had asked for it owing to the dangerous position of
the League of Schmalkalden, now that peace had been
concluded between the Emperor and Francis I. of France.
He had also enquired how far the allies might take advantage
of the war with the Turks; and whether they might make
their assistance against the Turks contingent upon certain
concessions being granted to the new worship. The second
question will be dealt with later;<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> as to the first, whether
resistance to the Emperor was allowed, the signatories
replied affirmatively in words which go further than any
previous admission.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">They had already, they say, “given their answer and opinion,
and there was no doubt that this was the Divine truth which
we are bound to confess even at the hour of death, viz. that
not only is defence permitted, but a protest is verily, and
indeed, incumbent on all.” Here it will be observed that
Luther no longer says merely that the lawyers inferred this
from the Imperial law, but that God, “to Whom we owe this
duty,” commanded that “idolatry and forbidden worship”
should not be tolerated. Numerous references to the “Word of
God” regarding the authorities were adduced in support of this
contention (Ps. lxxxii. 3; Exod. xx. 7; Ps. ii. 10, 11; 1 Tim.
i. 9). It is pointed out how in the Sacred Books the “Kings of
Juda are praised for exterminating idolatry.” “Every father
is bound to protect his wife and child from murder, and there is
no difference between a private murderer and the Emperor,
should he attempt unjust violence outside his office.” The case
is on all fours with one where the “overlord tries to impose on
his subjects blasphemy and idolatry,” hence war must be waged,
just as “Constantine fell upon Licinius, his ally and brother-in-law.”
David, Ezechias and other holy kings likewise risked life
and limb for the honour of God. “This is all to be understood as
referring to defence.” But “where the ban has been proclaimed
against one or more of the allies,” “discord has already broken
out.” Those under the ban have lost “position and dignity,”
and may commence the attack without further ado. Still, “it
is not for us to assume that hostilities should be commenced at
once”; this is the business of those actually concerned.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Such was the advice of Luther and those mentioned above
to the Elector, when he was about to attend a meeting of
the League of Schmalkalden at Frankfurt, where another
attempt was to be made to prevent the outbreak of hostilities
by negotiations with the Emperor’s ministers. Luther
was apprehensive of war as likely to lead to endless misfortunes,
yet his notion that “idolatry” must be rooted out
would allow of no yielding on his part. “It is almost certain
that this memorandum was made use of at the negotiations
preliminary to the Frankfurt conference, seeing that the
Elector in the final opinion he addressed to his councillors
repeats it almost word for word.”<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> The memorandum was
probably drawn up by Melanchthon.</p>

<p>At that very time Luther seems also to have received
news from Brandenburg that Joachim II., the Elector, was
about to Protestantise his lands. Such tidings would
naturally make him all the more defiant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Joachim, in spite of his sympathies for Lutheranism, had
hitherto refrained from formally embracing it, not wishing
to come into conflict with the Emperor. In 1539, however,
he publicly apostatised, casting to the winds all his earlier
promises. As Calvin wrote to Farel, in November, 1539,
Joachim had informed the Landgrave Philip of Hesse, his
chief tempter, that he had now made up his mind to “accept
the Gospel and to exterminate Popery,”<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> and this he did
with the best will, though he took no part in the Schmalkalden
War against the Emperor. In his case politics and
a disinclination to make war on the Emperor were the determining
factors.</p>

<p>While Joachim was still quietly pursuing his subversive
plans in the March of Brandenburg, the ever-recurring
question was already being discussed anew amongst the
Lutherans in that quarter, viz. whether Luther had not
previously, and with greater justice, declared himself
against resistance, and whether he was not therefore hostile
to the spirit of the League of Schmalkalden.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">A nobleman, Caspar von Kokeritz, probably one of Joachim’s
advisers, requested Luther to furnish the Protestant preacher at
Cottbus, Johann Ludicke, with a fresh opinion on the lawfulness
of resistance. The request was justified by the difference between
Luther’s earlier standpoint&mdash;which was well known at Cottbus&mdash;and
that which he had more recently adopted. From the
difficulty Luther sought to escape in a strongly worded letter to
Ludicke, dated February 8, 1539, which is in several ways
remarkable.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>In this letter the lawyers and the Princes again loom very
large. They had most emphatically urged the employment of
force, and “very strong reasons exist against my opposing this
desire and plan of our party.” In his earlier memorandum<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
he had been thinking of the Emperor as Emperor, but now he
had come to look on him as what he really was, viz. as a mere
“hireling” of the Pope. The Pope is desirous of carrying out
his “diabolical wickedness” with the help of the Emperor.
“Hence, if it is lawful to fight against the Turks and to defend
ourselves against them, how much more so against the Pope,
who is worse?” Still, he was willing to stand by his earlier opinion,
provided only that Pope, Cardinals and Emperor would admit
that they were all of them the devil’s own servants; “then my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
advice will be the same as before, viz. that we yield to the
heathen tyrants.” Other reasons too had led him, so he says, to
discard his previous opinion, but he is loath to commit them to
writing for fear lest something might reach the ears of “those
abominable ministers of Satan.” Instead, he launches out into
biblical proofs, urging that the “German Princes,” who together
with the Emperor governed the realm, “<i>communi consilio</i>,” had
more right to withstand the Emperor than the Jewish people
when they withstood Saul, or those others who, in the Old Testament,
resisted the authorities, and yet met with the Divine
approval. The constitution of the Empire might not be altered
by the Emperor, “who is not the monarch,” and “least of all in
the devil’s cause. He may not be aware that it is this cause that
he is furthering, but we know for certain that it is. Let what I
have said be enough for you, and leave the rest to the teaching of
the Spirit. Let your exhortation be to ‘render unto the Kaiser
the things that are the Kaiser’s.’ <i>Ceterum secretum meum
mihi.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>It is not difficult from the above to guess the “secret”: it
was the impending apostasy of the Electorate of Brandenburg.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Luther had already several times come into contact with
Joachim II. The Elector’s mother was friendly with him
and came frequently to Wittenberg. Concerning her foes
Luther once wrote to Jonas: “May the Lord Jesus give me
insight and eloquence against the darts of Satan.”<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> In his
letter of congratulation to the Elector on his apostasy he
hints more plainly at the opponents to whom he had referred
darkly in his letter to Ludicke: “I am less concerned about
the subtlety of the serpents than about the growl of the lion,
which perchance, coming from those in high places, may
disquiet your Electoral Highness.”<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>When the religious war of Schmalkalden at last broke out,
the foes of Wittenberg recalled Luther’s biblical admonitions
in 1530 against the use of arms in the cause of the
Gospel, which Cochlæus had already collected and published.
These they caused to be several times reprinted (1546), with
the object of showing the injustice of the protesters’ attitude
by the very words of the Reformer, who had died just before.
The Wittenberg theologians replied (1547), but their answer
only added to the tangle of the network of evasions. As a
counter-blast they printed Luther’s later memoranda, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
“Conclusions,” in favour of the use of force, adding prefaces
by Melanchthon and Bugenhagen; where the prefaces
come to deal with the awkward statement made by Luther
in 1530, the writers have recourse to the device of questioning
its authenticity; this Melanchthon does merely incidentally,
Bugenhagen of set purpose.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> According to
Bugenhagen, who, as a matter of fact, had himself assisted
in drawing up the statement, it deserved to be relegated
to the domain of fiction; Luther’s enemies, he says, had
fabricated the document in order to injure the Evangel.
He even asserted that he could quote Luther’s own assurances
in this matter; according to Caspar Cruciger,
Luther had declared in his presence that the memorandum
of 1530 had not “emanated” from him, though “carried
the rounds by his enemies.” Bugenhagen was unable to
understand, so he says, how his own name came to be there,
and repeatedly he speaks of the document as the “alleged”
letter. He also tells us that he had repudiated it as early as
1531, immediately after its publication by Cochlæus; if
this be true, then it is difficult to explain away his denial as
due to mere forgetfulness. His statements are altogether at
variance with what we are told by the physician, Matth.
Ratzeberger, Luther’s friend, who was always opposed to
the war, and who, in his tract of 1552, “A Warning against
Unrighteous Ways,” etc., blames Bugenhagen for his
repudiation of Luther’s authority.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> From the above it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
evident that we have no right to praise Bugenhagen, as has
been done in modern days, “for the fire with which he was
wont to advocate the truth.” Regarding Melanchthon’s
love of truth we shall have more to say later.</p>

<p class="p2">On looking back over the various statements made by
Luther concerning armed resistance, we cannot fail to be
struck by their diversity; the testimony they afford is the
reverse of favourable to their author’s consistency and
honesty.</p>

<p>By his very nature Luther felt himself drawn to proclaim
the right of armed resistance in the cause of the Evangel.
Of this feeling we have indications even at an early date in
certain unguarded outbursts which were repeated at
intervals in such a way as to leave no doubt as to his real
views. Yet, until 1530, his official and public statements,
particularly to the Princes, speak quite a different language.
The divergence was there and it was impossible to get rid of
it either by explanation or by denial. As soon as things
seemed about to lead inevitably to war, Luther saw that the
time had come to cast moderation to the winds. He was
unwilling to sacrifice his whole life-work, and the protesting
Estates had no intention of relinquishing their new rights
and privileges. Formerly it had seemed advisable and
serviceable to the spread of the Evangel to clothe it in the
garb of submissiveness to the supreme authority of the
Empire and of patient endurance for the sake of truth, but,
after the Diet of Augsburg such considerations no longer
held good. Overcoming whatever hesitation he still felt,
Luther yielded to the urgings of the secular politicians.</p>

<p>From that time his memoranda assumed a different
character. At the commencement of the change their wording
betrays the difficulties with which Luther found himself
faced when called upon to reconcile his later with his earlier
views. It was, however, not long before his combative
temper completely got the better of his scruples in Luther’s
writings and letters.</p>

<p>Nothing is more unhistorical than to imagine that his
guiding idea was “By the Word only,” in the sense of
deprecating all recourse to earthly weapons and desiring
that the Word should prevail simply by its own inherent
strength. He had spoken out his real mind when he said, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
1522: “Every power must yield to the Evangel, whether
willingly or unwillingly,” and again, in 1530, “Let things
take their course ... even though it come to war or
revolt.” Only on these lines can we explain his action. His
firm conviction of his own Divine mission (below, xvi.)
confirms this assumption.</p>

<h3>4. The Turks Without and the Turks [Papists] Within
the Empire</h3>

<p>The stupendous task of repelling the onslaught of the
Turkish power, which had cost Western Christendom such
great sacrifices in the past, was, at the commencement of the
third decade of the sixteenth century, the most pressing one
for both Hungary and the German Empire.</p>

<p>Sultan Suleiman the Second’s lust for conquest had,
since 1520, become a subject of the gravest misgivings in
the West. With the help of his countless warlike hordes he
had, in 1521, taken Belgrad, the strong outpost of the
Christian powers, and, after a terrible struggle, on December
25 of the following year, captured from the Knights of St.
John the strategically so important island of Rhodes.
There now seemed every likelihood of these victories being
followed up. The Kingdom of Hungary, which so long and
gloriously had stemmed the inroads of the infidel into
Christendom, now felt itself unable to cope single-handed
with the enemy and accordingly appealed to the Emperor
for help.</p>

<p>At the Diet of Nuremberg, in 1524, the Imperial Abschied
of April 18 held out a promise of assistance in the near
future, and even instanced tentatively the means to be
adopted by the Empire. In the meantime appeals were to
be made to the other Christian powers for help, so that
the final resolutions concerning the plan of defence might be
discussed and settled at the Spires Convention on November
11 of the same year.</p>

<p>Luther thought it his duty to interfere in these preparations.</p>

<h4><i>Against Assistance for the Turkish War.</i></h4>

<p>The Diet of Nuremberg had re-enacted the Edict of Worms
against Luther. It had requested the Pope to summon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
“free, general Council” in some suitable spot in Germany<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
“in order that good may not be overborne by evil, and that
true believers and subjects of Christ may be brought to a
firm belief in a common faith.” Incensed by the renewal of
the Edict of Worms against his doctrine and person, Luther
at once published an angry work, “Zwey keyserliche
uneynige und wydderwertige Gepott” (1524),<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> in which he
declared himself against the granting of any help whatever
against the Turks.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">He begins by saying of the authors of the new decree against
Lutheranism, that surely even “pigs and donkeys could see how
blindly and obstinately they were acting; it is abominable that
the Emperor and the Princes should openly deal in lies.” After
a lengthy discussion of the decree, he comes to the question of
the help which was so urgently needed in order to repel the
Turks; he says: “Finally I beg of you all, dear Christians,
that you will join in praying to God for those miserable, blinded
Princes, whom no doubt God Himself has placed over us as a
curse, that we may not follow them against the Turks, or give
money for this undertaking; for the Turks are ten times cleverer
and more devout than are our Princes. How can such fools,
who tempt and blaspheme God so greatly, expect to be successful
against the Turks?”<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>His chief reason for refusing help against the Turks was the
blasphemy against God of which the Princes of the Empire, and
the Emperor, had rendered themselves guilty by withstanding
his Evangel.</p>

<p>He declares, “I would ten times rather be dead than listen
to such blasphemy and insolence against the Divine Majesty....
God deliver us from them, and give us, in His mercy, other
rulers. Amen.”&mdash;The Emperor himself he charges with presumption
for daring&mdash;agreeably with age-long custom&mdash;to style
himself the chief Protector of the Christian faith. “Shamelessly
does the Emperor boast of this, he who is after all but a
perishable bag of worms, and not sure of his life for one moment.”
The Divine power of the faith has surely no need of a protector,
he says; he scoffs at him and at the King of England, who styles
himself Defender of the Faith; would that all pious Christians
“would take pity upon such mad, foolish, senseless, raving,
witless fools.”<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Even in the midst of the storm caused by his Indulgence
Theses, Luther had already opposed the lending of any
assistance against the Turks. A sermon preached in the
winter of 1518, in which he took this line, was circulated<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
by his friends. When Spalatin enquired of him in the
Elector’s name whether the Turkish War&mdash;for which
Cardinal Cajetan was just then asking for help&mdash;could be
justified by Holy Scripture, Luther replied, that the contrary
could be proved from many passages; that the Bible was
full of the unhappy results of wars undertaken in reliance on
human means; that those wars alone were successful where
heaven fought for the people; that now it was impossible to
count upon victory in view of the corruption of Christendom
and the tyranny and the hostility to Christ displayed by the
Roman Church; on the contrary, God was fighting against
them;<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> He must first be propitiated by tears, prayer,
amendment of life and a pure faith. In the Resolutions on
the Indulgence Theses we find the same antipathy to the
war, again justified on similar mystical and polemical
grounds.</p>

<p>His words in the Resolutions were even embodied by
Rome in one of the propositions condemned on the proclamation
of the ban: “To fight against the Turks is to withstand
God, Who is using them for the punishment of our sins.”<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">When, later, he came to approve of and advocate the war
against the Turks, he declared, quite frankly: “I am open to
confess that such an article was mine, and was advanced and
defended by me in the past.”</p>

<p>He adds that he would be ready to defend it even now were
things in the same state as then.&mdash;But where did he discern any
difference? According to him, people then, before he had
instructed them concerning its origin and office, had no idea of
what secular authority really was. “Princes and lords who
desired to be pious, looked upon their position and office as of no
account, not as being the service of God, and became mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
priests and monks.” But then he had written his “Von welltlicher
Uberkeytt” (1523). Having reinstated the secular
authority, so long “smothered and neglected,” he was loath to
see it summoned against the Turks by the Pope. Besides, he is
quite confident that the Pope had never been in earnest about
the Turkish War; his real aim was to enrich his exchequer.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>Luther also explains that from the first he had been inclined to
oppose the granting of any aid against the Turks on the theological
ground embodied in his condemned proposition, viz.
that God visits our sins upon us by means of the Turks. Here
again he will not admit himself to have been in the wrong, for
Christians must “endure wrong, violence or injustice ... not
resist evil, but allow and suffer all things” as the Gospel teaches.
Characteristically enough, he appeals to that “piece of Christian
doctrine” according to which the Christian is to offer his left
cheek to him who smites him on the right, and leave his cloak to
the man who takes away his coat. Now, what our Lord taught
in His Sermon on the Mount (Matt. v. 39 f.), was not, as he had
already pointed out, a mere counsel of perfection, but a real
command; but the “Pope with his schools and convents had
made of this a counsel which it was permissible not to keep, and
which a Christian might neglect, and had thus distorted the
words of Christ, taught the whole world a falsehood, and cheated
Christians.”<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> A way out of the fatal consequences which must
ensue, Luther fancies he is able to find in the distinction between
the true Christian and mere worldly citizen; it was not incumbent
on the latter to perform everything that was binding on the
former.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Previous to writing his “Von welltlicher Uberkeytt,” referred
to above, he had again publicly expressed himself as
opposed to the efforts of the Empire on behalf of the Turkish
War; though no longer because the authorities lacked a
right sense of their office, or because Christ’s counsel made
submission a duty, but for quite another reason: Before
taking any steps against the Turks it was necessary to resist
the impious dominion of the Pope, compared with which
the danger from the Turks paled into insignificance. “To
what purpose is it,” he wrote in 1522, “to oppose the
Turk? What harm does the Turk do? He invades a
country and becomes its secular ruler.... The Turk also
leaves each one free to believe as he pleases.” In both
respects the Pope is worse; his invasions are more extensive,
and, at the same time, he slays the souls, so that “as regards
both body and soul the government of the Pope is ten times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
worse than that of the Turk.... If ever the Turks were to
be exterminated it would be necessary first to begin with the
Pope.” The Christian method of withstanding the Turks
would be to “preach the Gospel to them.”<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> This paved the
way for his warning, in 1524, against complying with the
Emperor’s call for assistance in fighting the Turks (above,
p. 77).</p>

<p>Such exhortations not to wage war against the Turks
naturally tended to confuse the multitude to the last degree.</p>

<p>Incautious Lutheran preachers also did their share in
stirring up high and low against the burden of taxes imposed
by the wars. Hence it was quite commonly alleged against
the instigator of the religious innovations that, mainly
owing to his action after the Diet of Spires, there was a
general reluctance to grant the necessary supplies, though
the clouds on the eastern horizon of the Empire were growing
ever blacker. After the horrible disaster at Mohacz, in
1526, Luther therefore found it necessary to exculpate himself
before the public.</p>

<h4><i>In Favour of Assistance for the Turkish War.</i></h4>

<p>Luther gradually arrived at the decision that it was his
duty to put his pen at the service of the war against the
Turks.</p>

<p>A change took place in his attitude similar to that which
had occurred in 1525 at the time of the Peasant Rising,
which his words, and those of the Reformed preachers, had
done not a little to further.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">His friends, he says in 1529, “because the Turk was now so
near,” had insisted on his finishing a writing against them
which had already been commenced; “more particularly
because of some unskilful preachers among us Germans, who, I
regret to learn, are teaching the people that they must not fight
against the Turks.” Some, he writes, also taught, that “it was
not becoming for any Christian to wield the sword”; others
went so far as to look forward to the coming of the Turks and
their rule. “And such error and malice amongst the people
is all placed at Luther’s door, as the fruit of my Evangel; in the
same way that I had to bear the blame of the revolt [of the
peasants].... Hence I am under the necessity of writing on
the matter and of exculpating us, both for my own sake and for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>that of the Evangel ... in order that innocent consciences may
not continue to be deceived by such calumnies, and be rendered
suspicious of me and my teaching, or be wrongly led to believe
that they must not fight against the Turks.”<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">In February, 1528, Suleiman II. was in a position to
demand that King Ferdinand should evacuate Buda-Pesth,
the capital; it was already feared that his threat of visiting
Ferdinand in Austria might be all too speedily fulfilled.
The Sultan actually commenced, in the spring of 1529, his
great campaign, which brought him to the very walls of
Vienna. The city, however, defended itself with such
heroism that the enemy was at last compelled to withdraw.</p>

<p>In April, 1529, when the reports of the danger which
menaced Austria had penetrated throughout the length and
breadth of Germany, Luther at last published the writing
above referred to, viz. “On the Turkish War.”</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">The booklet he dedicated to that zealous patron of the Reformation,
Landgrave Philip of Hesse. In it his intention is to
teach “how to fight with a good conscience.” He points out
how the Emperor, as a secular ruler, must, agreeably with the
office conferred on him by God, protect his subjects against the
Turks, as against murderers and robbers, with the secular sword,
which, however, has nothing to do with the faith. There were
two who must wage the war, Christian and Charles; but Christian’s
duty was merely that of the faithful everywhere who would pray
for the success of the campaign; this was all that the believers,
as such, had to do; Charles would fight, because the example
of Charles the Great would encourage him to bear the sword
bravely, but only against the Turks as robbers and disturbers of
the peace; it would be no Crusade, such as had been undertaken
against the infidel in the foolish days of old. Amongst the most
powerful pages of the work are those in which, regardless of
flattery, he impresses on the German Princes the need of union,
of sacrifice of private interests and of obedience to the guidance
of the Emperor, without which it was useless to hope for anything
in the present critical condition of the Empire. He scourges
with a like severity certain faults into which Germans were
prone to fall when engaged in warfare, viz. to under-estimate the
strength of the enemy, and to neglect following up their victories;
instead of this, they would sit down and tipple until they again
found themselves in straits.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>It does not, however, seem that these words of Luther’s on
behalf of the war against the Turks raised any great enthusiasm
among the people.</p></div>

<p class="p1">He again took up his pen, and this time more open-heartedly,
when, on October 14, the hour of Vienna’s
deliverance came and the last assault had been happily
repulsed. The result was his “Heer-Predigt widder den
Türcken” addressed to all the Germans. Here he sought
to instruct them from Scripture concerning the Turks and
the approaching Last Day. In stirring, homely words he
exhorted them to rise and lend their assistance, pointing
out that whoever fell in the struggle died a martyr. He
fired the enthusiasm of his readers by even quoting the
examples of the women and maidens in olden Germany.
He also dwelt on the need of preserving the faith in captivity
should it be the lot of any of the combatants to be taken
prisoner, and even exhorted those who might be sold as
slaves not to prove unfaithful by running away from their
lawful masters. He consoled his readers at the same time
with the thought, to which he ever attached such importance,
that, after all, in Turkey the devil did not rage nearly
so furiously against Christians as the devil at home, i.e. the
Pope, who was forcing them to deny Christ.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>We likewise find attacks on the Catholic fraction of the
German nation, mingled with exhortations to resist the
Turks, in a Preface he composed in 1530, on the occasion of
the republication of an older work dating from Catholic
times, “On the Morals and Religion of the Turks.”<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>The struggle raging in the heart of Germany, and the
opposition of the Protestant Princes and Estates to the
Emperor as head of the Realm, constituted the greatest
obstacle to any scheme for united and vigorous action against
the Turks. Hence to some extent Luther was indirectly
responsible for the growth of the Ottoman Empire. On one
occasion Luther gave vent to the following outburst:
“Would that we Germans stood shoulder to shoulder, then
it would be easy for us to resist the Turk. If we had 50,000
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>foot and 10,000 horse constantly in the field ... we could
well withstand them and defend ourselves.”<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> The Sultan
had, long before, taken into his calculations the dissensions
created by Luther in the Empire.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> On one occasion, about
1532, as we know from Luther’s “Talk Table,” Suleiman made
enquiries of a German named Schmaltz, who was attached
to an embassy, concerning Luther’s circumstances, and asked
how old he was. To the answer that he was forty-eight
years of age he replied: “I would he were still younger,
for he would find a gracious master in me.” Luther,
when this was reported to him, made the sign of the cross
and said: “May God preserve me from such a gracious
master.”<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>Luther, as we shall see below, had occasion to write
against the Turks even at a later date. His writings had,
however, no widespread influence; they were read only by
one portion of the German nation, being avoided by the rest
as works of an arch-heretic. Many marvelled at his audacity
in presuming to teach the whole nation, and at his speaking
as though he had been the leader of the people. Catholics
were inclined, as Luther himself complains, to regard the
growth of the Turkish power as God’s chastisement for the
apostasy of a part of Germany and for the Emperor’s
remissness in the matter of heresy.</p>

<p>Even in his very tracts against the Turks, Luther did much
to weaken the force of his call to arms. His aim should
have been to inspire the people with enthusiasm and a
readiness to sacrifice themselves, which might, in turn, have
encouraged and fired the nobles; but, as the experience of
earlier ages had already proved, religion alone was able to
produce such a change in the temper of a nation. Protection
for the common, spiritual heritage, defence of the religion
and civilisation of the West, such was the only appeal which
could have fired people’s minds. And it was this banner
which the Church unfurled, both before and after Luther’s
day, which had led to victory at the battle of Lepanto
and again at the raising of the siege of Vienna. Luther,
on the contrary, in his writing of 1529, repels so vehemently
any idea of turning the contest with the infidel into a
crusade, that he even has it that, “were I a soldier and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
descried on the field of battle a priestly banner, or one
bearing a cross, or even a crucifix, I would turn and run as
though the devil were at my heels; and, if, by God’s
Providence, they nevertheless gained the victory, still I
should take no share in the booty or the triumph.”<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>To insure a favourable issue to the campaign it was also
necessary that the position of the Emperor as head of
Christendom should be recognised, and the feeling of common
interest between the sovereigns and nations be kindled
anew. Yet the progress of the innovations, and Luther’s
own menacing attitude towards the Empire and the Catholic
sovereigns, was contributing largely to shatter both the
authority of the Empire and the old European unity, not to
speak of the injury done to the Papal authority, to whose
guidance the common welfare of Christendom had formerly
been confided.</p>

<p>Luther allowed his polemics to blunt entirely the effect of
his summons. As, however, what he says affords us an
insight into the working of his mind, it is of interest to the
psychologist.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">In the second of the two writings referred to above, the “Heer-Predigt,”
despite the general excellence of its contents, the
constant harping on the nearness of the Last Day could not fail
to exert an influence the reverse of that desired. At the very
commencement he ventilates his views on the prophecies of
Daniel; he likewise will have it that the prophecy concerning Gog
and Magog in Ezechiel also refers to the Turks, and that we even
read of them in the Apocalypse; their victories portended the
end of all things. His last warnings run as follows: “In the
end it will come about that the devil will attack Christendom
with all his might and from every side.... Therefore let us
watch and be valiant in a firm faith in Christ, and let each one be
obedient to the authorities and see what God will do, leaving
things to take their course; for there is nothing good to be hoped
for any more.”<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Such pessimism was scarcely calculated to
awaken enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Nor does he conceal his fears lest a successful campaign against
the Turks should lead the Emperor and the Catholic Princes to
turn their arms against the Evangelicals, in order to carry out
the Edict of Worms. He so frequently betrays this apprehension
that we might almost be led to think that he regarded the
Turkish peril as a welcome impediment, did we not know on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
other hand how greatly he came to dread it as he advanced in
years. This anxiety concerning possible intentions of the
Catholics he felt so keenly in 1529 as to append to the second of
his tracts on the Turkish War a peculiarly inappropriate monition,
viz. that Germans “must not allow themselves to be made use
of against the Evangel, or fight against or persecute Christians;
for thus they would become guilty of innocent blood and be no
better than the Turks.... In such a case no subject is in the
least bound to obey the authorities, in fact, where this occurs,
all authority is abrogated.”<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>Injudicious considerations such as these are also to be found
in the earlier tract; here, however, what is most astonishing is
his obstinacy in re-affirming his earlier doctrine, already condemned
by Rome, viz. that it was not becoming in Christians, as
such, to resist the Turk by force of arms, seeing that God was
using the Turks for the chastisement of Christendom. “As we
refuse to learn from Scripture,” he says, speaking in his wonted
mystical tone, “the Turk must teach us with the sword, until
we learn by sad experience that Christians must not fight or
resist evil. Fools’ backs must be dusted with the stick.”<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> He
also expresses his misgivings because “Christians and Princes are
so greatly urged, driven and incited to attack the Turks and fall
upon them, before we have amended our own lives and begun
to live as true Christians”; on this account “war was not to be
recommended.”<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Real amendment would have consisted in
accepting the Lutheran Evangel. Yet, instead of embracing
Lutheranism, “our Princes are negotiating how best to molest
Luther and the Evangel; there, surely, is the real Turk.”<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
Because they had ordered fasts, and penitential practices, and
Masses of the Holy Ghost, in order to implore God’s protection
against the Turk, the Catholic Princes drew down upon themselves
the following rebuke: “Shall God be gracious to you,
faithless rulers of unfortunate subjects! What devil urges you
to make such a fuss about spiritual matters, which are not
your business, but concern God and the conscience alone, and to
do the work God has committed to you and which does concern
you and your poor people, so lazily and slothfully even in this
time of the direst need, thus merely hindering those who would
fain give you their help?”<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>Here again he was promoting dissension, indeed, generally
speaking, his exhortations were more a hindrance than a help;
again and again he insists on entangling himself anew in his
polemics against Popery, and this in spite of the urgent needs of
Germany. Led by the Pope, the Catholic Princes have become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
“our tyrants,” who “imprison us, exercise compulsion, banish
and burn us, behead and drown us and treat us worse than do
the Turks.”<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>“In short, wherever we go, the devil, our real landlord, is at
home. If we visit the Turk, we find the devil; if we remain
under the rule of the Pope, we fall into hell. There is nothing
but devils on either side and everywhere.” Thus it must be with
mankind, he says, referring to 2 Timothy iii. 1, when the world
reaches its end.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>In “what manner I advise war on the Turk, this my booklet
shall be witness.”<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>Cochlæus, Luther’s opponent, collected the contradictions
contained in the latter’s statements on the Turkish War, and
published them in 1529 at Leipzig in the form of an amusing
Dialogue. In this work one of the characters, Lutherus, attacks
the war in Luther’s own words, the second, Palinodus, defends
it, again with Lutheran phrases, whilst an ambassador of King
Ferdinand plays the part of the interested enquirer. The work
instances fifteen “contradictions.”<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Luther personally acted wisely, for it was of the utmost
importance to him to destroy the impression that he stood
in the way of united action against the Turks. This the
Princes and Estates who protested at the Diet of Spires
were far less willing to do. They cast aside all scruple and
openly refused to lend their assistance against the Turks
unless the enactment against the religious innovations were
rescinded. It is true that Vienna was then not yet in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
pressing danger, though, on the other hand, news had been
received at Spires that the Turkish fleet was cruising off the
coasts of Sicily. It was only later on in the year, when the
danger of Austria and for the German Princes began to
increase, that the Protesters showed signs of relenting.
They also saw that, just then, their refusal to co-operate
would be of no advantage to the new Church. Landgrave
Philip of Hesse nevertheless persisted in his obstinate
refusal to take any part in the defence of the Empire.</p>

<p>Philip made several attempts to induce Brück, the
Chancellor of the Saxon Electorate, and Luther, to bring
their influence to bear on the Elector Johann Frederick so
that he might take a similar line. Brück was sufficiently
astute to avoid making any promise. Luther did not
venture openly to refuse, though his position as principal
theological adviser would have qualified him to explain to
the Landgrave the error of his way. In his reply he merely
finds fault with the “Priesthood,” who “are so obstinate
and defiant and trust in the Emperor and in human aid.”
God’s assistance against the Turks may be reckoned on, but
if it came to the point, and he were obliged to speak to the
Elector, he would “advise for the best,” and, may God’s
Will be done.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>When the Turks, in order to avenge the defeat they had
suffered before the walls of Vienna, prepared for further
attacks upon the West, frightful rumours began to spread
throughout Germany, adding greatly to Luther’s trouble of
mind. At the Coburg, where he then was, gloomy forebodings
of the coming destruction of Germany at the hand
of the Turk associated themselves with other disquieting
considerations.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">In one of his first letters from the Coburg he says to Melanchthon,
Spalatin and Lindemann, who were then at the Diet of
Augsburg: “My whole soul begins to revolt against the Turks
and Mohammed, for I see the intolerable wrath of Satan who
rages so proudly against the souls and bodies of men. I shall
pray and weep and never rest until heaven hears my cry. You
[at Augsburg] are suffering persecution from our monsters at
home, but we have been chosen to witness and to suffer both
woes [viz. Catholicism and the Turks] which are raging together
and making their final onslaught. The onslaught itself proves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
and foretells their approaching end and our salvation.”<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>&mdash;“All
we now await is the coming of Christ,” so he says on another
occasion in one of his fits of fear; “verily, I fear the Turk will
traverse it [Germany] from end to end.... How often do I
think of the plight of our German land, how often do I sweat,
because it will not hear me.”<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>Lost in his eschatological dream and misled by his morbid
apprehension, he wrote his Commentary on Ezechiel xxxviii.-xxxix.,
which was at once placed in the hands of the printer;
here again he finds the mischief to be wrought by the Turks at
the end of the world as plainly foretold as in the prophecy of
Daniel, the Commentary on which he had published shortly
before.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Everywhere anxiety reigned supreme, for there were
lacking both preparedness and unanimity. The Catholic
Princes of the Empire were not much better than the rest.
Petty interests and jealousies outweighed in many instances
a sense of the common needs. At Spires, for instance, Duke
George of Saxony stipulated, as a condition of any promise
of assistance, that he should be given precedence over both
the Dukes of Bavaria. While the Catholic Estates agreed,
at the Diet of Augsburg, to the grants for the war against
the Turks, the Protestant Estates were not to be induced to
give a favourable decision until the Emperor had sanctioned
the so-called religious Peace of Nuremberg in 1532.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>In the summer of that same year Suleiman passed Buda-Pesth
with 300,000 men. Thence he continued his march
along the Danube with the intention of taking Vienna, this
time at any cost. The Emperor Charles V. hurried in person
to command the great army which was collecting near
Vienna; the Sultan was to be encountered and a decisive
battle fought. Throughout the Empire the greatest enthusiasm
for the cause prevailed. The Electoral Prince,
Joachim of Brandenburg, was nominated by the Emperor
to the command of the troops of the Saxon lowlands,
since this country had not been unanimous in the choice of
a Captain, probably owing to the religious dissensions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The Protestant Prince Joachim requested a pious letter
from Luther. This Luther sent him, promising him his
prayers, and saying that “he would take the field in spirit
with his dear Emperor Carol [as he now calls him], and
fight under his banner against Satan and his members.”
He prayed God to bestow on them all “a glad spirit,”
granting them not to trust in their own strength, but to
fight with the “fear of God, trusting in His Grace alone,”
and to ascribe the honour to heaven only; hitherto there
had been too much of the “spirit of defiance on both sides,”
and each party had gone into the field “without God,”
“which on every occasion had been worse for the people of
God than for the enemy.” Luther was evidently quite
incapable of writing on the subject without his polemical
ideas casting their shadow over his field of vision.</p>

<p>The Turks did not venture to give battle, but, to the joy
of the Christian army, retreated, laying waste Styria on
their march. The Imperial troops were disbanded and an
armistice was concluded between King Ferdinand and
Suleiman. But in 1536 the hostilities were renewed by the
Turks; Hungary was as good as lost, and in 1537 Ferdinand’s
army suffered in Slavonia the worst reverse, so at least
Luther was informed, since the battle of Mohacz in 1526. On
the strength of a rumour he attributed the misfortune to
the treason of the Christian generals. In his conversations
he set down the defeat to the account of Ferdinand, his
zealous Catholic opponent; he had permitted “such a
great and powerful army to be led miserably into the jaws
of the Turks.”<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Ferdinand, the Emperor’s brother, was, of
course, to blame for the unfortunate issue of the affair;
“hitherto the Turk has been provoked by Ferdinand and
has been victorious; when he comes unprovoked, then he
will succumb and be defeated; if the Papists commence
the war they will be beaten.”<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> “Luther saw in the misfortune
of King Ferdinand a just punishment on him
and his friends who angered God and worshipped lies.”<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
He believed the cause of the success of the Turks to be
the “great blasphemy of the Papists against God and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
abominable sin against one and the other Table of the
Commandments of God”; also “the great contempt of
God’s Word amongst our own people.”<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>While the Protestant Princes and cities again showed a
tendency to exploit the Turkish peril to the advantage of
the religious innovations, Luther, in view of the needs of the
time, pulled himself together and, when consulted, openly
advised the Elector Johann Frederick to give his assistance
against the Turks should this be asked of him. (May 29,
1538.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>)</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">He writes to the Elector: “‘<i>Necessitas</i>’ knows no ‘<i>legem</i>,’
and where there is necessity everything that is termed law,
treaty or agreement ceases.... We must risk both good and
evil with our brothers, like good comrades, as man and wife,
father and children risk all things together.” “Because many
pious and honest people will also have to suffer,” it was meet
that the Prince should, “with a good conscience, render assistance
in order to help and protect, not the tyrants, but the poor little
flock.”</p>

<p>Yet, immediately after, he deprives his counsel of most of its
weight by declaring in fatalistic language, that there was nevertheless
little to be hoped for, since God “had fashioned the rod
which they will not be able to resist.”</p>

<p>He tells him concerning King Ferdinand, “that there was
nothing to be anticipated from him, but only trouble and inevitable
misfortune”; of the Catholics in general he assures him,
that their “blasphemy” against the Evangel and their resistance
to “their conscience and the known truth” made it impossible
for them to escape a “great chastisement,” since “God liveth
and reigneth.”</p>

<p>Again, as though desirous of deterring the Elector on personal
grounds, he reminds him that they (the “tyrants” as he calls
the Princes of the Catholic party) “had not so far even requested
assistance, and had not been willing to agree to peace though the
need was so great.”<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> He also thoughtfully alludes to the danger
lest the tyrants, after having secured a victory with the help of
the Protestants, should make use of their arms to overthrow the
Evangel by force: “We must be wary lest, should our adversaries
vanquish the Turks&mdash;which I cannot believe they will&mdash;they
then turn their arms against us,” “which they would gladly
do”; but, he adds, “it rests in God’s hands not in their desire,
what they do to us, or what we are to suffer, as we have experienced
so far,” for instance after the retreat of the Turks from
Vienna when, “after all, nothing was undertaken against us”;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
for the people would refuse to follow them in any attack upon the
Evangel.</p></div>

<p class="p1">This letter, which has frequently been appealed to by
Protestants as a proof of Luther’s pure, unselfish patriotism,
is a strange mixture of contradictory thoughts and emotions,
the product of a mind not entirely sure of its ground and
influenced by all sorts of political considerations. Of one
thing alone was the writer certain, viz. that the Turk at
Rome must be fought against relentlessly.</p>

<p>Luther’s “Table-Talk” and occasional letters supply
various traits to complete the above picture of his attitude
towards the Turkish War. There we find polemical outbursts
interspersed with excellent admonitions to prayer,<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
confutations of the errors of the Turks, and lamentations on
the judgment of God as displayed in these wars.</p>

<h4><i>Luther on Turks and Papists.</i></h4>

<div class="pbq">

<p>“If Germany had a master,” he says very aptly on one occasion,
“it would be easy for us to withstand the Turk”; but, he
continues, “the Papists are our worst foes, and would prefer to
see Germany laid waste, and this the Turk is desirous of doing.”<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
The Papists are actually trying to establish the domination of
the Turk. “The Pope,” so he was informed, “refuses, like the
King of France, to grant any assistance to the Emperor against
the Turks. See the enormities of our day! And yet this is the
money [which the Pope refused to give] that the Popes have been
heaping up for so many long ages by means of their Indulgences.”<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
“I greatly fear,” he says to his friends, “the alliance between
the Papists and the Turks by which they intend to bring us to
ruin. God grant that my prophecy may prove false.... If
this enters the heads of the Papists, they will do it, for the malice
of the devil is incredible ... they will plot and scheme how to
betray us and deliver us over into the hands of the Turk.”<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile he believes that God is fighting for his cause by
rendering the Turks victorious: “See how often the Papists with
their hatred of the Evangel and their trust in the Emperor have
been set at nought”; they had reckoned on the destruction of
the Lutherans by means of Charles the Fifth’s victory over
France, but, lo, “a great French army marches against the
Emperor, Italy falls away and the Turk attacks Germany; this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
mean that God has dispersed the proud. Ah, my good God, it is
Thou Who hast done this thing!”<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>&mdash;On one occasion he declared:
“In order that it might be discerned and felt that God was not
with us in the war against the Turks, He has never inspired our
Princes with sufficient courage and spirit earnestly to set about
the Turkish War.... Nowhere is anything determined upon
or carried out.... Why is this? In order that my Article,
which Pope Leo condemned, may remain ever true and uncondemned.”<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>When, in the spring of 1532, Rome itself stood in fear of the
Turk and many even took to flight, a letter reached Wittenberg
announcing the consternation which prevailed there in the
Eternal City. Then probably it was that Luther spoke the
words which have been transmitted in both the Latin and German
versions of the “Table-Talk”: “Should the Turk advance against
Rome, I shall not regret it. For we read in the Prophet Daniel:
‘He shall fix his tabernacle between the seas upon a glorious and
holy mountain.’” The two seas he imagined to be the Tyrrhenean
and the Adriatic, whilst the holy mountain meant Rome, “for
Rome is holy on account of the many Saints who are buried
there. This is true, for the abomination which is the Pope, was
[according to Daniel ix. 27] to take up its abode in the holy city.
If the Turk reaches Rome, then the Last Day is certainly not far
off.”<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>It would even seem that it was his fervent desire to see Antichrist
ousted by the Turk which allured him into the obscure
region of biblical prophecy.</p>

<p>“Accordingly I hope for the end of the world. The Emperor
Charles and Solimannus represent the last dregs of worldly
domination. Christ will come, for Scripture knows nothing of
any other monarchy, and the signs of the end of the world are
already visible.”<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> “The rule of the Turk was foretold in Daniel
and in the Apocalypse that the pious might not allow themselves
to be terrified at his greatness. The prophecy of Daniel gives us
a splendid account of what is to happen till the end of the world,
and describes clearly the reign of Antichrist and of the Turk.”<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
Finally, Luther is of opinion that at the end of the world both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
must be united, viz. the Papal Antichrist and the Turk, because
both had come into being together. About the time of the
Emperor Phocas († 610) Mohammed appeared on the scene of
history, and at that very time too the Bishops of Rome arrogated
to themselves the primacy over the whole Church.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>His pseudo-mysticism and factious temper thus continued to
play an unmistakable part in his ideas concerning the Turk.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">“Against such might and power [the Turkish] we Germans
behave like pot-bellied pigs, we idle about, gorge, tipple and
gamble, and commit all kinds of wantonness and roguery,
heedless of all the great and pitiful slaughters and defeats
which our poor German soldiery have suffered.”<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> “And,
because our German people are a wild and unruly race,
half diabolical and half human, some even desire the advent
and rule of the Turk.”<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>So scathing a description of the German people leads us
to enquire into his attitude to German nationalism.</p>

<h3>5. Luther’s Nationalism and Patriotism</h3>

<p>In spite of his outspoken criticism of their faults, Luther
recognised and honoured the good qualities of the Germans.
His denunciations at times were certainly rather severe:
“We Germans,” he says, “remain Germans, i.e. pigs and
brutes”;<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> and again, “We vile Germans are horrid swine”;
“for the most part such shocking pigs are we hopeless
Germans that neither modesty, discipline nor reason is to be
found in us”;<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> we are a “nation of barbarians,” etc.
Germans, according to him, abuse the gifts of God “worse
than would hogs.”<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> He is fond of using such language when
censuring the corruption of morals which had arisen owing
to abuse and disregard of the Evangel which he preached.
Even where he attempts to explain his manner of proceeding,
where, for instance, he tries to justify the delay in forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the “Assembly of true Christians,” he knows how to display
to the worst advantage the unpleasing side of the German
character. “We Germans are a wild, savage, blustering
people with whom it is not easy to do anything except in
case of dire necessity.”<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>By the side of such spiteful explosions must be set the
many kindlier and not unmerited testimonies Luther gives
to the good qualities peculiar to the nation.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> In various
passages, more particularly in his “Table-Talk,” he credits
the Germans with perseverance and steadfastness in their
undertakings, also with industry, contentment and disinterestedness;
they had not indeed the grace of the
Italians, nor the eloquence of the French, but they were
more honest and straightforward, and had more homely
affection for their good old customs. He also believes that
they had formerly been distinguished for great fidelity,
“particularly in marriage,” though unfortunately this was
no longer the case.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>Much more instructive than any such expressions of
opinion, favourable or unfavourable, is the attitude Luther
adopted towards the political questions which concerned
the existence, the unity and the greatness of his country.</p>

<p>Here his religious standpoint induced him to take steps
which a true German could only regret. We have already
shown how the defence against the Turks was hampered by
his action. He also appreciably degraded the Empire in
the eyes of the Christian nations.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> He not merely attacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the authority of the Emperor and thereby the power which
held together the Empire, by his criticism of the edicts of the
Diets, by the spirit of discord and party feeling he aroused
amongst those who shared his opinions, and by his unmeasured
and incessant abuse of the authorities, but, as
years went by, he also came even to approve, as we have
seen above (p. 53 ff.), of armed resistance to the Emperor
and the Empire as something lawful, nay, praiseworthy,
if undertaken on behalf of the new Evangel.</p>

<p>“If it is lawful to defend ourselves against the Turk,” he
writes, “then it is still more lawful to do so against the Pope,
who is even worse. Since the Emperor has associated himself
with the defenders of the Pope, he must expect to be
treated as his wickedness deserves.” “Formerly I advised
that we should yield to the Emperor [i.e. not undertake
anything against him]; even now I still say that we should
yield to these heathen tyrants when they&mdash;Pope, Cardinals,
Bishops, Emperor, etc.&mdash;cease to appeal to the name of
Christ, but acknowledge themselves to be what they really
are, viz. slaves of Satan; but if, in the name of Christ,
they wish to stone Christians, then their stones will recoil
on their own heads and they will incur the penalty attached
to the Second Commandment.”<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>He saw “no difference between an assassin and the
Emperor,” should the latter proceed against his party&mdash;a
course which, as a matter of fact, was imposed on the
Emperor by the very laws of the Empire. How, he asks,
“can a man sacrifice his body and this poor life in a higher
and more praiseworthy cause” “than in such worship
[resistance by violence] for the saving of God’s honour and
the protection of poor Christendom, as David, Ezechias and
other holy kings and princes did?”<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>Countless examples from the Old Testament such as the
above were always at his command for the purpose of
illustrating his arguments.</p>

<p>In the “Warnunge an seine lieben Deudschen,” in 1531,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
he warns the Imperial power that God, “even though He
Himself sit still, may well raise up a Judas Machabeus”
should the Imperial forces have recourse to arms against
the “Evangelicals”; their enemies would learn what their
ancestors had learned in the war with Ziska and the Husites.
Resistance to “bloodhounds” is, after all, mere self-defence.
Whoever followed the Emperor against him and his party
became guilty of all the Emperor’s own “godless abominations.”
To instruct “his German people” on this matter
was the object of the writing above referred to.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>“As I am the Prophet of the Germans&mdash;this high-sounding
title I am obliged to assume to please my asinine Papists&mdash;I
will act as a faithful teacher and warn my staunch Germans
of the danger in which they stand.”<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>By thus coming forward as the divinely commissioned
spokesman of the Germans, as the representative and
prophet of the nation, he implicitly denied to those who did
not follow his banner the right of being styled Germans. He
was fond of professing, in his war on Pope and Church, to
be the champion of the Germans against Rome’s oppression.
This enabled him to stir up the national feeling amongst
those who followed him as his allies, and to win over the
vacillating by means of the delusive watchword: “Germany
against Italian tyranny.” But, apart from the absolute
want of justification for any such appeal to national prejudices,
the assumption that Germany was wholly on his
side was entirely wrong. He spoke merely in the name of a
fraction of the German nation. To those who remained
faithful to the Church and who, often at great costs to
themselves, defended the heritage of their pious German
forefathers, it was a grievous insult that German nationalism
should thus be identified with the new faith and Church.</p>

<p>Even at the present time in the German-speaking world
Catholics stand to Protestants in the relation of two-fifths
to three-fifths, and, if it would be a mistake to-day to regard
Teutonism and Protestantism as synonymous&mdash;a mistake
only to be met with where deepest prejudice prevails&mdash;still
better founded were the complaints of Catholics in Luther’s
own time, that he should identify the new Saxon doctrines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
with the German name and the interests of Germany as a
whole.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>Even in the first years of his public career he appealed to
his readers’ patriotism as against Rome. In 1518, before
he had even thought of his aggressive pamphlet “To the
German Nobility,” he commended the German Princes for
coming forward to protect the German people against the
extortions of the Roman Curia; “Prierias, Cajetan and Co.
call us blockheads, simpletons, beasts and barbarians, and
scoff at the patience with which we allow ourselves to be
deceived.”<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> In the following year, when this charge had
already become one of his stock complaints, he summed it
up thus: “We Germans, through our emperors, bestowed
power and prestige on the Popes in olden days and, now, in
return, we are forced to submit to being fleeced and
plundered.”<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> In the writing against Alveld, “Von dem
Bapstum tzu Rome,” a year later, he declared in words
calculated to excite the ire of every Teuton, that in Rome
they were determined to suck the last farthing out of the
“tipsy Germans,” as they termed them; unless Princes
and nobles defended themselves to the utmost the Italians
would make of Germany a wilderness. “At Rome they
even have a saying about us, viz. ‘We must milk the
German fools of their cash the best way we can.’”<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>That Luther should have conducted his attacks on the
Papacy on these lines was due in part to Ulrich von Hutten’s
influence. Theodore Kolde has rightly pointed out, that
his acquaintance with Hutten’s writings largely accounts
for the utter virulence of Luther’s assault on “Romanism.”<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>
There is no doubt that the sparks of hate which emanated
from this frivolous and revolutionary humanist contributed
to kindle the somewhat peculiar patriotism of the Wittenberg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
professor. All the good that Rome had brought to
Germany in the shape of Christian culture was lost to sight
in the whirlwind of revolt heralded by Hutten; the financial
oppression exercised by the Curia, and the opposition between
German and Italian, were grossly exaggerated by the
knights.</p>

<p>Specifically German elements played, however, their part
in Luther’s movement. The famous <i>Gravamina Nationis
Germanicæ</i> had been formulated before Luther began to
exploit them. Another German element was the peculiar
mysticism, viz. that of Tauler and the “Theologia Deutsch,”
on which, though he misapprehended much of it, Luther
at the outset based his theories. German frankness and
love of freedom also appeared to find their utterance in the
plain and vigorous denunciations which the Monk of Wittenberg
addressed to high and low alike; even his uncouth
boldness found a strong echo in the national character. And
yet it was not so much “national fellow-feeling,”<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> to quote
the expression of a Protestant author, which insured him
such success, but other far more deeply seated causes, some
of which will be touched upon later, while others have
already been discussed.</p>

<p>It is, however, noteworthy that this “Prophet of the
Germans,” when speaking to the nation he was so fond of
calling his own, did not scruple to predict for it the gloomiest
future.</p>

<p>A dark pessimism broods over Luther’s spirit almost
constantly whenever he speaks of the years awaiting
Germany; he sees the people, owing to his innovations,
confronted with disastrous civil wars, split up into endless
and perpetually increasing sects and thus brought face to
face with hopeless moral degradation. His cry is, Let the
Empire dissolve, “Let Germany perish.” “Let the world
fall into ruins.”<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> He consoles himself with the reflection
that Christ, when founding His Church, had foreseen and
sanctioned the inevitable destruction of all hostile powers,
of Judaism and even of the Roman Empire. It was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
nature of the Gospel to triumph by the destruction of all
that withstood it. It was certainly a misfortune, Luther
admits, that the wickedness of the Germans, every day
growing worse, should be the cause of this ruin. “I am
very hopeless about Germany now that she has harboured
within her walls those real Turks and devils, viz. avarice,
usury, tyranny, dissensions and this Lernean serpent of envy
and malice which has entangled the nobles, the Court, every
Rathaus, town and village, to say nothing of the contempt
for the Divine Word and unprecedented ingratitude
[towards the new Evangel].” This is how he wrote to
Lauterbach.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Writing to Jonas, he declared: “No improvement
need be looked for in Germany whether the
realm be in the hands of the Turk or in our own, for the
only aim of the nobility and Princes is how they can enslave
Germany and suck the people dry and make everything
their very own.”<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>The lack of any real national feeling among the Princes
was another element which caused him anxiety. Yet he
himself had done as much as any to further the spread of
that “particularism” which to a great extent had replaced
the national German ideal; he had unduly exalted the
rights of the petty sovereigns by giving them the spiritual
privileges and property of the Church, and he had confirmed
them in their efforts to render themselves entirely independent
of the Emperor and to establish themselves as
despots within their own territories. Since the unhappy
war of 1525 the peasantry and lower classes were convinced
that no remedy was to be found in religion for the
amelioration of their social condition, and had come to hate
both Luther and the lords, because they believed both to
have been instrumental in increasing their burdens. The
other classes, instead of thanking him for furthering the
German cause, also complained of having had to suffer on
his account. In this connection we may mention the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
grievance of the mercantile community, Luther having
deemed it necessary to denounce as morally dangerous any
oversea trade.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> It was also a grievous blow to education
and learning in Germany, when, owing to the storm which
Luther let loose, the Universities were condemned to a long
period of enforced inactivity.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> He himself professed that
his particular mission was to awaken interest in the Bible,
not to promote learning; yet Germans owe him small thanks
for opposing as he did the discoveries of the famous German
Canon of Frauenburg, Niklas Koppernigk (Copernicus), and
for describing the founder of modern astronomy as a fool
who wished to upset all the previous science of the heavens.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>Whilst showing himself ultra-conservative where good
and useful progress in secular matters was concerned, he,
on the other hand, scrupled not to sacrifice the real and
vital interests of his nation in the question of public ecclesiastical
conditions by his want of conservatism and his
revolutionary innovations. True conservatism would have
endeavoured to protect the German commonwealth and to
preserve it from disaster by a strict guard over the good and
tried elements on which it rested, more particularly over
unchangeable dogma. The wilful destruction of the heritage,
social, religious and learned, contributed to by countless
generations of devout forebears ever since the time of
St. Boniface, at the expense of untold toil and self-sacrifice,
can certainly not be described as patriotic on the part of
a German. At any rate, it can never have occurred to anyone
seriously to expect that those Germans whose views on
religion were not those of Luther should have taken his
view of the duty of a patriot.</p>

<p>The main fact remains that Luther’s action drove a
wedge into the unity of the German nation. Wherever his
spirit prevailed&mdash;which was by no means the case in every
place which to some extent came under his influence&mdash;there
also prevailed prejudice, suspicion and mistrust against
all non-Lutherans, rendering difficult any co-operation for
the welfare of the fatherland.</p>

<p>In discussing a recent work which extols Luther as a
“true German” a learned Protestant gives it as his opinion,
that, however much one may be inclined to exalt his patriotism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
it must, nevertheless, be allowed that Luther cherished
a sort of indifference to the vital interests of his nation; his
“religious concentration” made him less mindful of true
patriotism; this our author excuses by the remark:
“Justice and truth were more to him than home and
people.” Luther, it is also said, “did not clearly point out
the independent, ethical value of a national feeling, just as
he omitted to insist at all clearly on the reaction of the
ethical upon the religious.”<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, however, his ways and feelings are
often represented as the “very type and model of the true
German.”<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Nor is this view to be found among Protestants
only, for Ignatius von Döllinger adopted it in later life,
when he saw fit to abandon his previous position.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Before this, in 1851, in his Sketch of Luther, he had indeed
said, concerning his patriotism, that, in his handling of the
language and the use he made of the peculiarities of his countrymen,
“he possessed a wonderful gift of charming his hearers,
and that his power as a popular orator was based on an accurate
knowledge and appreciation of the foibles of the German national
character.”<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> In 1861, he wrote in another work: “Luther is
the most powerful demagogue and the most popular character
that Germany has ever possessed.” “From the mind of this
man, the greatest German of his day, sprang the Protestant
faith. Before the ascendency and creative energy of this mind,
the more aspiring and vigorous portion of the nation humbly
and trustfully bent the knee. In him, who so well united in
himself intellect and force, they recognised their master; in his
ideas they lived; to them he seemed the hero in whom the nation
with all its peculiarities was embodied. They admired him, they
surrendered themselves to him because they believed they had
found in him their ideal, and because they found in his writings
their own most intimate feelings, only expressed more clearly,
more eloquently and more powerfully than they themselves
were capable of doing. Thus Luther’s name is to Germany not
merely that of a distinguished man, but the very embodiment
of a pregnant period in national life, the centre of a new circle of
ideas and the most concise expression of those religious and
ethical views amidst which the German spirit moved, and the
powerful influence of which not even those who were averse to
them could altogether escape.”<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>Here special stress is laid on Luther’s power over “the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
aspiring Germans” who followed him, i.e. over the Protestant
portion of the nation. Elsewhere, however, in 1872, Döllinger
brings under Luther’s irresistible spell “his time and his people,”
i.e. the whole of Germany, quite regardless of the fact that the
larger portion still remained Catholic. “Luther’s overpowering
mind and extraordinary versatility made him the man of his
time and of his people; there never was a German who understood
his people so well, or who in turn was so thoroughly understood,
yea, drunk in, by the people, as this Monk of Wittenberg.
The mind and spirit of the German people were in his hands like
a harp in the hands of the musician. For had he not bestowed
upon them more than ever one man had given to his people since
the dawn of Christianity? A new language, popular handbooks,
a German Bible, and his hymns. He alone impressed upon the
German language and the German spirit alike his own imperishable
seal, so that even those amongst us who abhor him from the
bottom of our hearts as the mighty heresiarch who seduced the
German nation cannot help speaking with his words and thinking
with his thoughts. Yet, even more powerful than this Titan of
the intellectual sphere, was the longing of the German nation
for freedom from the bonds of a corrupt ecclesiasticism.”<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>The change in Döllinger’s conception of Luther which is here
apparent was not simply due to his personal antagonism to the
Vatican Council; it is closely connected with his then efforts,
proclaimed even in the very title of the Lectures in question:
“Reunion of the Christian Churches”; for this reunion Döllinger
hoped to be able to pave the way without the assistance of, and
even in opposition to, the Roman Catholic Church. The fact is,
however, that in the above passages the domination which Luther
exercised over those who had fallen away with him has been
made far too much of, otherwise how can we explain Luther’s own
incessant complaints regarding the small response to the preaching
of his new Evangel? The production of a schism by his vehement
and forceful oratory was one thing; vigorous direction and
leadership in the task of religious reconstruction was quite a
different matter.</p></div>

<p class="p1">It is not our intention here to embark upon a controversy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
on such an opinion concerning Luther’s German influence
as that here advanced by Döllinger. The present work
will, in due course, treat of Luther’s posthumous influence
on German culture and the German language, of his famous
German Bible, and of his hymnological work (see vol. v.,
xxxiv., xxxv.), when we shall have occasion to show the true
value to be accorded to such statements. As they stand,
our last quotations from Döllinger merely constitute a part
of the legend which grew up long since around the memory
of the Wittenberg professor.</p>

<p>It must certainly be admitted, that Luther’s powerful
language is grounded on a lively and clear comprehension
of German ways of thought and German modes of expression;
his command of language and his power for
trenchant description, which were the result of his character,
of his intercourse with the common people and his talent
for noting their familiar ways of speech, were rare qualities.
He left in his writings much that served as a model to later
Germans. Of his translation of the Bible in particular we
may say, with Janssen, that, although Luther cannot be
termed the actual founder of the new High-German, yet
“his deserts as regards the development of the German
language are great,” especially in the matter of “syntax and
style. In the last respect no one of any insight will wish to
dispute the service which Luther rendered.” “The force
and expression of the popular speech was hit off by Luther
in a masterly manner in his Bible translations.”<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>Those Germans, who had been won over to the new faith
and had become Luther’s faithful followers, found in the
instructions written in his own popular vein, particularly in
those on the Bible, enlightenment and edification, in many
cases, no doubt, much to their advantage. Writing for the
benefit of this circle, the versatile author, in his ethical
works&mdash;his controversial ones are not here under consideration&mdash;deals
with countless other subjects outside the range
of biblical teaching; here his manner owes its power to the
fact that he speaks in tones caught from the lips of the
people themselves. Thus, for instance, when he discovers
the blots which sully the nation: luxury in dress, the
avarice of the rich, the “miserliness and hoarding” of the
peasants. Or when he tells unpleasant truths to the “great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
fops,” the nobles, concerning their despotic and arrogant
behaviour. Or, again, when he raises his voice in condemnation
of the neglect of education, or to reprove excessive
drinking, or when, to mention a special case, he paints in lurid
and amusing colours the slothfulness and utter carelessness
of the Germans after having achieved any success in war
against the Turks. His gift of humour always stood him in
good stead, and his love of extravagant phraseology and
imagery and of incisive rhetoric was of the greatest service
to him in his dealings with the people, for both appealed
strongly to German taste. Nor must we forget his proficiency
in the effective application of German proverbs&mdash;a
collection of proverbs in his own handwriting is still extant
and has recently been published&mdash;nor his familiarity with
German folk-lore and ballads, nor finally the wonderful gift
which served to tranquillise many who were still undecided
and wavering, viz. the boundless assurance and unshakable
confidence with which he could advance even the most
novel and startling opinions. The Germans of that day
loved weight and power, and a strong man could not fail to
impress them, hence, for those who were not restrained by
obedience to the Church, Luther undoubtedly seemed a
real chip off the old German block.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">A single passage, one against usurers, will serve to show with
what energy this man of the people could raise his voice, to the
joy of the many who groaned under the burden. “Ah, how
securely the usurer lives and rages as though he himself were
God and Lord of the whole land; no one dares to resist him.
And now that I write against them these saintly usurers scoff at
me and say: ‘Luther doesn’t know what usury is; let him read
his Matthew and his Psalter.’ But I preach Christ and my word
is the Word of God, and of this I am well assured, that you
accursed usurers shall be taught either by the Turk or by some
other tool of God’s wrath, that Luther really knew and understood
what usury was. At any rate, my warning is worth a
sterling gulden.”<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>On the very same page he vents his anger against the supreme
Imperial Court of Justice, because, “in matters pertaining to
the Gospel and the Church,” its sentences did not accord with
his. “I shan’t be a hypocrite, but shall speak the truth and say:
See what a devil’s strumpet reigns in the Imperial Kammergericht,
which ought to be a heavenly jewel in the German land,
the one consolation of all who suffer injustice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Particularly effective was his incitement of the people to hate
Popery. “We Germans must remain Germans and the Pope’s
own donkeys and victims, even though we are brayed in the
mortar like sodden barley, as Solomon says (Prov. xxvii. 22);
we stick fast in our folly. No complaints, no instruction, no
beseeching, no imploring, not even our own daily experience of
how we have been fleeced and devoured opens our eyes.”<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>&mdash;“The
Emperor and the Princes,” he had already said, “openly
go about telling lies of us”;<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> “pigs and donkeys,” “mad and
tipsy Princes,” such are the usual epithets with which he spices
his language here and later.</p>

<p>“Out of deep sympathy for us poor Germans”<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> it is that he
ventures to speak thus in the name of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>He boldly holds up his Evangel as the German preaching <i>par
excellence</i>. He declares: “I seek the welfare and salvation of
you Germans.”<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>&mdash;“We Germans have heard the true Word of
God for many years, by which means God, the Father of all Mercy,
has enlightened us and called us from the horrible abominations
of the Papal darkness and idolatry into His holy light and
Kingdom. But with what gratitude and honesty we have
accepted and practised it, it is terrible to contemplate.”</p>

<p>Formerly, he says, we filled every corner with idolatries such
as Masses, Veneration of the Saints, and good works, but now
we persecute the dear Word, so that it would not be surprising
should God flood Germany, not only with Turks, but with real
devils; indeed, it is a wonder He has not done so already.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>However small the hope was of any improvement resulting
from his preaching, he fomented the incipient schism by such
words as these: “They [the Romans] have always abused our
simplicity by their wantonness and tyranny; they call us mad
Germans, who allow themselves to be hoaxed and made fools of....
We are supposed to have an Empire, but it is the Pope who
has our possessions, honour, body, soul and everything else....
Thus the Pope feeds on the kernel and we nibble at the empty
shells.”<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Finally, there are some who select certain traits of
Luther’s character in order to represent him as the type of
a true German. Such specifically German characteristics
were certainly not lacking in Luther; it would be strange,
indeed, were this not the case in a man of German stock,
hailing from the lower class and who was always in close
touch with his compatriots. Luther was inured to fatigue,
simple in his appearance and habits, persevering and enduring;
in intercourse with his friends he was frank, hearty
and unaffected; with them he was sympathetic, amiable
and fond of a joke; he did not, however, shrink from telling
them the truth even when thereby offence might be given;
towards the Princes who were well-disposed to him and his
party he behaved with an easy freedom of manner, not
cringingly or with any exaggerated deference. In a sense
all these are German traits.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> But many of these qualities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
albeit good in themselves, owing to his public controversy,
assumed a very unpleasant character. His perseverance
degenerated into obstinacy and defiance, his laborious
endurance into a passionate activity which overtaxed his
powers, and he became combative and quarrelsome and
found his greatest pleasure in the discomfiture of his
opponents; his frankness made way for the coarsest
criticism. The anger against the Church which carried him
along found expression in the worst sorts of insults, and,
when his violence had aroused bitter feelings, he believed,
or at least alleged, he was merely acting in the interests of
uprightness and love of truth. Had he preserved his
heritage of good German qualities, perfected them and
devoted them to the service of a better cause, he might
have become the acknowledged spokesman of all Germans
everywhere. He could have branded vice and instilled into
the hearts of his countrymen the love of virtue more strongly
and effectively than even Geiler of Kaysersberg; in seasoned
and effective satire on matters of morals he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
have far excelled Sebastian Brant and Thomas Murner;
in depth of feeling and sympathetic expression he could have
rivalled Bertold of Ratisbon, and his homely ways would
have qualified him to enforce the Christian precepts amongst
all the grades and conditions of German life even more
effectively than any previous preacher.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">THE DIVINE MISSION AND ITS MANIFESTATIONS</p>

<h3>1. Growth of Luther’s Idea of his Divine Mission</h3>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">Whereas</span> the most zealous of Luther’s earliest pupils
and followers outvied one another in depicting their
master as the messenger of God, who had come
before the world equipped with revelations from on
high, the tendency of later Protestantism has been, more
and more, to reduce Luther, so to speak, to a merely
natural level, and to represent him as a hero indeed,
but as one inspired by merely human motives. An earlier
generation exalted him to mystical regions, and, being
nearer him in point of time and therefore knowing him
better, grasped the fact that he was dominated by a certain
supernaturalism. Many later and more recent writers, on
the other hand, have preferred to square their conception of
his personality with their own liberal views on religion.
They hail Luther as the champion of free thought and
therefore as the founder of modern intellectual life. What
he discovered in his struggles with himself by reflection and
pious meditation, that, they say, he bequeathed to posterity
without insisting upon the immutability of his ideas or
claiming for them any infallibility. His only permanent
work, his real legacy to posterity, was a negative one,
viz. the breach with Popery, which he consummated, thanks
to his extraordinary powers.</p>

<p>This is, however, from the religious standpoint, to attenuate
Luther’s figure as it appears in history, notwithstanding
the tribute paid to his talents.</p>

<p>If he is not the “messenger of God,” whose doctrines,
inspired from on high, the world was bound to accept,
then he ceases to be Luther, for it was from his supernatural
estimate of himself that he drew all his strength and defiance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Force him to quit the dim, mystical heights from which he
fancies he exercises his sway, and his claim on the faith of
mankind becomes inexplicable and he himself an enigma.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out above, how Luther gradually
reached the conviction that he had received his doctrine
by a special revelation, with the Divine mission to communicate
it to the world and to reform the Church (vol. ii.,
p. 92 f.). The conviction, that, as he declares, “the Holy
Ghost had revealed the Scriptures” to him culminated in
that personal assurance of salvation which was suddenly
vouchsafed to him in the Tower.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>It will repay us to examine more closely the nature of this
idea, and its manifestations, now that we have the mature
man before us.</p>

<p>The founder of the new Church has reached a period
when he no longer scruples to speak of the “revelations”
which had been made to him, and which he is compelled to
proclaim. “By His Grace,” he says, “God has revealed this
doctrine to me.”<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>&mdash;“I have it by revelation ... that will
I not deny.”<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Of his mission he assures us: “By God’s
revelation I am called to be a sort of antipope”;<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> of his
chief dogma, he will have it that “the Holy Ghost bestowed
it upon me,”<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> and declares that “under pain of the curse of
eternal reprobation” he had been “instructed (‘<i>interminatum</i>’)
not to doubt of it in any way.”<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Of this he solemnly
assured the Elector Frederick in a letter written in 1522:
“Concerning my cause I would say: Your Electoral Highness
is aware, or, if not aware, is hereby apprised of the fact,
that I received the Evangel, not from man, but from heaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
alone through our Lord Jesus Christ, so that I might well
subscribe myself and boast of being a minister and evangelist&mdash;as,
indeed, I shall do for the future.”<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>It is because he has received the Word of God direct from
on high that he is so firm. “God’s Word,” he cries, “is
above everything to me; I have the Divine Majesty on my
side, therefore I care not in the least though a thousand
Augustines, or a thousand Harry-Churches [Henry VIII. of
England was then still a Catholic] should be against me; I
am quite certain that the true Church holds fast with me
to God’s Word, and leaves it to the Harry-Churches to
depend on the words of men.”<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>There are many passages in which he merely claims to
have been enlightened in his ruminations and labours
and thus led to embrace the real, saving truth; less
frequently do we hear of any actual, sudden inspiration
from above. Where he does claim this most distinctly is
in the matter of the discovery of his chief doctrine, viz.
assurance of salvation by justifying faith, vouchsafed to
him in the Tower of the Wittenberg monastery. The fact
that his mode of expression varies may be explained not
merely by his own involuntary wavering, but by the very
difficulty of imparting his favourite doctrine to others. His
frame of mind, outward circumstances and the character of
his hearers or readers were the cause of his choice of words.
With his friends, for instance, more particularly the younger
ones, and likewise in his sermons at Wittenberg, he was fond
of laying stress on what he had once said to the lawyers
when they molested him with Canon Law: “They shall
respect our teaching, which is the Word of God spoken by
the Holy Ghost through our lips.”<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> When speaking to
larger audiences, on the other hand, he does not as a rule
claim more than a gradual, inner enlightenment by God,
which indeed partakes of the nature of a revelation, but to
which he was led by his work and study and inward experience.
In the presence of the fanatics he became, after
1524, more cautious in his claims, owing to the similar ones
made on their own behalf by these sectarians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet the idea of an assurance born of God lies at the bottom
of all his statements.</p>

<p>He worked himself into this belief until it became part of
his nature.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> He had to face many doubts and scruples, but
he overcame them, and, in the latter years of his life, we
hear little of any such. His struggle with these doubts,
which clearly betray the faulty basis of his conviction, will
be dealt with elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>“I am certain and am determined to feel so.” Expressions
such as this are not seldom to be met with in Luther’s
letters and writings.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>An almost appalling strength of will lurks behind such
assurances. Indeed, what impels him seems to savour more
of self-suggestion than of inward experience. To the objections
brought forward by his adversaries he frequently
enough merely opposes his “certainty”; behind this
he endeavours to conceal the defects of his proofs from
Scripture, and his inability to reply to the reasons urged
against him. His determination to find conviction constitutes
one of Luther’s salient psychological characteristics;
of the Titanic strength at his disposal he made proof first
and foremost in his own case.</p>

<p class="p2">Luther also succeeded in inducing in himself a pseudo-mystic
mood in which he fancied himself acting in everything
conformably with a Divine mission, everywhere
specially guided and protected as beseemed a messenger of
God.</p>

<p>For instance, he says that he wrote the pamphlet against
the seditious peasants in obedience to a Divine command;
“therefore my little book is right and will always be so,
though all the world should be incensed at it.”<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>“It is the Lord Who has done this,” he had declared of
the Peasant Rising when he recognised in it elements favourable
to his cause; “It is the Lord Who has done this and
Who conceals these menaces and dangers from the eyes of
the Princes, and will even bring it about Himself by means
of their blindness and violence.” That the Princes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
threatened with destruction, that “I firmly believe the
Spirit proclaims through me.”<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>Later on he was no less sure that he could foresee in the
Spirit the coming outbreak of a religious war in Germany;
only the prayers which he&mdash;who had the Divine interests
so much at heart&mdash;offered, could avail to stave off the war;
at least the delay was mainly the result of this prayer: “I
am assured that God really hearkens to my prayer, and I
know that so long as I live there will be no war in Germany.”</p>

<p>Never does he tire of declaring that the misfortunes and
deaths which his foes have to deplore are the result of the
intervention of heaven on behalf of his cause.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> He was convinced
that he had repeatedly been cured in sickness and
saved from death by Christ, by Him, as he says in 1534,
“in Whose faith I commenced all this and carried it through,
to the admiration even of my opponents.”<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> He, “one of the
Apostles and Evangelists of Germany, is,” so he proclaims
in 1526 in a pamphlet, “a man delivered over to death and
only preserved in life by a wonder and in defiance of the
wrath of the devil and his saints.”<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>In February, 1520, he speaks of the intimation he has
received of a great storm impending, were God not to place
some hindrance in the way of Satan. “I have seen Satan’s
cunning plans for my destruction and that of many others.
Doubtless the Divine Word can never be administered without
confusion, tumult and danger. It is a word of boundless
majesty, it works great things and is wonderful on high.”
This was to be his only guide in his undertaking. He was
compelled, so he declared on the same occasion, “to leave
the whole matter to God, to resign himself to His guidance
and to look on while wind and waves make the ship their
plaything.”<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>He frequently repeats later that his professorship at the
University had been bestowed upon him by a Divine dispensation
and against his will; whereas others were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
honoured for their academic labours, he complains to
Spalatin of being persecuted; “I teach against my will
and yet I have to endure evil things.” “What I now do and
have done, I was compelled to do.” “I have enough sins
on my conscience without incurring the unpardonable one
of being unfaithful to my office, of refraining from scourging
evil and of neglecting the truth to the detriment of so many
thousand souls.”<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>&mdash;At the time when the Disputation at
Leipzig was preparing, he tells the same confidant that
the matter must be left to God: “I do not desire that it
should happen according to our designs, otherwise I would
prefer to desist from it altogether.” Spalatin must not
desire to see the matter judged and settled according to
human wisdom, but should remember that we know nothing
of “God’s plans.”<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>Everything had befallen him in accordance with God’s
design. It was in accordance therewith, nay, “at the command
of God,” that he had become a monk, so at least he
says later. This, too, was his reason for giving up the
office in choir and the recitation of the Breviary. “Our
Lord God dragged me by force from the canonical hours,
anno 1520.”<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> His marriage likewise was the direct result
of God’s plan. “The Lord suddenly flung me into matrimony
in a wonderful way while my thoughts were set in
quite another direction.”<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> At an earlier date he had, so he
said, defended the theses of his Resolutions only “because
God compelled him to advance all these propositions.”<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>His first encounter with Dr. Eck took place, so he was
persuaded, “at God’s behest.”<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> “God takes good care that
I should not be idle.”<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> It is God Who “calls and compels
him” to return to Wittenberg after his stay at the Wartburg.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>&mdash;It
is not surprising, then, that he also attributes
to God’s doing the increase in the number of his friends and
followers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The success of his efforts to bring about a great falling
away from the Catholic Church he regarded as a clear
Divine confirmation of his mission, so that “no higher proof
or miracle was needed.”<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> Even the disturbance and tumult
which resulted bore witness in his favour, since Christ says:
“I am come to send a sword.” All around him prevailed
“discord, revolt and uproar,”<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> because, forsooth, the Gospel
was there at work; the calm, unquestioned sovereignty of
Popery within its own boundaries was a sure sign of its
being the devil’s own.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> “Did I not meet with curses, I
should not believe that my cause was from God.”<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>It is evident from these and other like statements how
greatly his fame, the increase of his followers and his unexpected
success engrossed and intoxicated him. In judging
of him we must not under-estimate the effect of the din of
applause in encouraging him in his self-suggestion. The
cheers of so great a crowd, as Erasmus remarked in a letter
to Melanchthon, might well have turned the head even of
the humblest man. What anchor could have held the bark
exposed to such a storm? Outbursts such as the following, to
which Luther gave vent under the influence of the deafening
ovation, were only to be expected of such a man as he,
when he had once cut himself adrift from the Church:
“God has now given judgment ... and, contrary to the
expectation of the whole world, has brought things to such
a pass.... The position of the Pope grows daily worse,
that we may extol the work of God herein.”<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Under the
magic influence of the unhoped-for growth of his movement
of revolt, he declared it could only be due to a higher power,
“which so disposed things that even the gates of hell were
unable to prevent them.” Not he, but “another man,
drives the wheel.” It is as clear as day that no man could,
single-handed, have achieved so much, and, by “mere
word of mouth,” done more harm to the Pope, the bishops,
priests and monks than all worldly powers hitherto.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> Christ
was working for him so strenuously, so he declares in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
seriousness, that he might well calmly await His complete
victory over Antichrist; for this reason there was really no
need to trouble about the ecclesiastical organisation of the
new Church, or to think of all the things it would otherwise
have been necessary for him to remember.</p>

<p>His mere success was not the only Divine witness in his
favour; Luther was also of opinion that owing to God’s
notable working, signs and wonders had taken place in
plenty in confirmation of the new teaching; such Divine
wonders, however, must not be “thrown to the winds.”<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
He seems, nevertheless, to have had at one time the intention
of collecting and publishing these miracles.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>In short, “the first-fruits of the Grace of God,” he says,
have come upon us; in these he was unwilling that later
teachers, who differed from him, should be allowed to
participate.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>Was not the guidance of Christ also plainly visible in the
fact that he, the proclaimer of His Word, had been delivered
from so many ambushes on the part of the enemies who
lay in wait for him? Such a thought lay at the root of his
words to his pupil Mathesius: There was no doubt that
poison had frequently been administered to him, but “an
important personage had been heard to say, that none had
any effect on him.” On one occasion, however, when an
attempt had been made to poison him, He “Who said, ‘If
they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them,’ blessed
him, and preserved him then and afterwards from all
mischief.”<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> “I also believe,” Luther once said, according
to Bindseil’s Latin “<i>Colloquia</i>,” that “my pulpit-chair and
cushion were frequently poisoned, yet God preserved me.”<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
Similar words are recorded in the Diary of Cordatus.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> This
accounts for the strange tales which grew up amongst his
pupils and followers of how “God Almighty had always
preserved him in a wonderful manner,” of how He “had
affrighted the knaves” who sought his life, and so forth, of
which the early editions of Luther’s Works have so much
to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the characteristics most highly extolled by his
earliest followers as exemplifying his mission must be
instanced, first, his inflexible courage, amounting frequently
to foolhardiness, in the accomplishment of his set task, viz.
the establishing of the Evangel and the destruction of
Popery; secondly, his extraordinary capacity for work and
the perseverance of which he gave such signal proof in his
literary undertakings; thirdly, his entire disregard for
temporal advantages, which he himself held up as an
example to those of the evangelical preachers whose worldliness
had become a reproach to the Lutheran cause.</p>

<p>Very strange and remarkable is the connection between
Luther’s mysticism and the simple and homely view he took
of life; the pleasure with which he welcomed everything
good which came in his way&mdash;so far as it was free from any
trace of Popery&mdash;the kindly, practical turn of his manner
of thinking and acting when among his own people, and
that love for humour and good cheer which so strikingly
contrasts with the puritanical behaviour of his opponents,
the Anabaptists and fanatics.</p>

<p>To reconcile his mysticism with habits at first blush so
divergent would present quite a problem in itself were we
not to take into account the fact, that homeliness and
humour had been his from the very beginning, whereas his
mysticism was a later growth, always to some extent alien
to his character. His mysticism he carefully confined to
what related to his supposed Divine mission, though at times
he does indeed seem to extend indefinitely the range of this
mission. Yet, when the duties of his office had cost him
pain or tried his temper, he was ever glad to return to the
realities of life, and to seek relief in social intercourse or in
his family circle.</p>

<p>When it was a question of the working of miracles by the
heaven-sent messenger, he was of too practical a turn of
mind to appeal to anything but the ostensible tokens of the
Divine favour worked around him and on his behalf in
proof of the truth of the new Evangel. He carefully
avoided attributing any miracles to his own powers, even
when assisted by Divine grace, though, occasionally, he
seems to imply that, were the need to arise, he might well
work wonders by the power of God, were he only to
ask it of Him. With the question of miracles and predictions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
as proofs of Luther’s Divine mission we shall deal
later (p. 153 ff.).</p>

<p>While on the one hand Luther’s views of miracles and
prophecies witness to an error which was not without effect
on his persuasion of his Divine mission, on the other his
pseudo-mystic notion of his special calling led him superstitiously
to see in chance events of history either the
extraordinary confirmation of his mission or the celestial
condemnation of Popery.</p>

<p>We know that Luther not only shared the superstitions
of his contemporaries, but also defended them with all the
weight of his great name and literary talents.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> When at
Vienna, in January, 1520, something unusual was perceived
in the sky, he at once referred it to “his tragedy,” as he had
done even previously in similar cases. He also expressed
the wish that he himself might be favoured with some such
sign. The noisy spirits which had formerly disturbed
people had, he believed, been reduced in number throughout
the world solely owing to his Evangel. The omnipotence
of the devil and the evil he worked on men was, so he
thought, to be restrained only by the power of that Word
which had again been made known to the world, thanks to
his preaching.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> It was his intention to publish an account
of the demoniacal happenings which had taken place in his
day and which confirmed his mission; he was only prevented
from doing this by want of time.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> To astrology,
unlike Melanchthon, he ever showed himself averse.</p>

<p>Another element which loomed large in his persuasion
that he was a prophet was his so-called “temptations,”
i.e. the mental troubles, which, so he thought, were caused
by the devil and which, coinciding as they often did with
other sufferings, were sometimes the cause of long fits of
misery and dejection.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>These temptations in their most extreme form Luther
compared with the death-agony. His extraordinary experiences,
of which he never understood the pathological
cause, were regarded by him as God’s own testimony to
his election. His conviction was that, by imposing on him
these pangs of hell, God was cleansing him for the grand
task assigned to him, even as He had done with other
favoured souls in the past. When plunged in the abyss of
such sufferings he felt like St. Paul, the Apostle of the
Gentiles, who likewise was buffeted by Satan (vol. i., p. 381 f.),
and whom he would fain have emulated in his “revelations”
of the Divine mysteries. Only in the sequel, however, will
it be possible to describe Luther’s pathology for the benefit
of those to whom it may be of interest.</p>

<p>All his troubles, whether due to doubt and sadness or to
the fury of foes stirred up by Satan against him, he utilised,
so he tells us, as an incentive to immerse himself ever more
and more in the study of Holy Scripture, to cultivate the
understanding bestowed upon him, and to seek its practical
applications. “My theology was not all learnt in a day;
I was obliged to explore deeper and deeper to acquire it. My
temptations helped me, for it is impossible to understand
Holy Scripture without experience and temptations. This
is what the fanatics and unruly spirits lack, viz. that capital
gainsayer the devil, who alone can teach a man this. St.
Paul had a devil, who beat him with his fists and drove him
by the way of temptation diligently to study Holy Scripture.
I have had the Pope, the Universities and all the scholars,
and, behind them all, the devil, hanging round my neck:
they drove me to the Bible and made me read it until at
length I reached the right understanding of it. Unless we
have such a devil, we remain mere speculative theologians,
for whose precious imaginings the world is not much
better.”<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> This casual saying of Luther’s gives us a good
glimpse into his customary process of thought when in
presence of troubles and temptations, great or small.</p>

<p>The above passage, moreover, agrees with many similar
statements of his, inasmuch as, far from ascribing his
doctrine to any actual revelation, he makes its discovery to
result from effort on his part, under the guidance of a higher
illumination. Luther, less than any other, could scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
have been unconscious of the gradual change in his views,
more particularly at the outset of his career as Evangelist
and prophet; at the very least it was clear that, in the
earlier period of his higher mission, he had taught much
that was borrowed from Popery and which he discarded
only later; at that time, as he puts it, he was still “besotted
with Popery.”</p>


<h4><i>Periodic Upheaval of Luther’s Idea of his Divine Mission.</i></h4>

<p>Luther’s consciousness of his Divine mission found
expression with varying degrees of intensity at different
periods of his life.</p>

<p>At certain junctures, notably when historic events were
impending, it was apt to burst forth, producing in him
effects of a character almost terrifying. Such was the case,
for instance, in the days which immediately preceded and
followed the proclamation of the Bull of Excommunication.
At that time it seemed as though every spirit of revolt had
entered into him to use him as a tool for defying the authority
of the Church. Such was the depth of his persuasion, that
he, the excommunicate, was carried away to proclaim his
unassailable prophetic rights in tones of the utmost conviction.</p>

<p>Towards the end of his stay at the Wartburg and during the
first period of his struggle with the Anabaptists at Wittenberg,
we again hear him insisting on his own exalted mission;
owing, however, to the mystic illumination of which the
fanatics boasted, his claims are now based, not so much on
mystical considerations, as on the “outward Word,” whose
authentic representative he had, by his works, proved
himself to be.</p>

<p>The loneliness and gloom of the Wartburg and his
“diabolical” experiences there doubtless helped to convince
him yet more of the reality of his mission. The ensuing
struggle with those of the innovators who differed from him
and even threatened to oust him, acted as a further stimulus
and aroused his powers of resistance to the utmost. Nor
must we forget the threatening attitude of the Imperial
authorities at Nuremberg, whom he was resolved to oppose
with the greatest determination; only by impressing on
his followers that he was something more than human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
would it be possible for him successfully to hold in check the
hostility of Emperor and Princes. The supposed world-wide
success of his venture also dazed him at this critical juncture,
a fact which further elucidates the situation.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Triumphantly he cries: “The Lord has already begun to
mock at Satan and his slaves. Satan is in truth vanquished,
and the Pope, too, with all his abominations! Now our only
concern is the soap-bubble which has swelled to such alarming
dimensions [the Nuremberg menace]. We believe in Christ, the
Son of God, believe in His dominion over life and death. Whom
then shall we fear? The first-fruits of victory have already fallen
to us; we rejoice at the overthrow of the Papal tyranny, whereas
formerly Kings and Princes were content to submit to its oppression;
how much easier will it be to vanquish and despise the
Princes themselves!”</p>

<p>“If Christ assures us,” he continues in this same letter, one of
the first dispatched after his “Patmos” at the Wartburg, “that
the Father has placed all things under His feet, it is certain that
He lieth not; ‘all things’ must also comprise the mighty ones
assembled at Nuremberg, not to speak of that Dresden bubble
[Duke George of Saxony]. Let them therefore set about deposing
Christ. We, however, will calmly look on while the Father
Almighty preserves His Son at His right hand from the face
and the tail of these smoking firebrands” (Isa. vii. 4). Should a
rising or a tumult among the people ensue “which cannot be
suppressed by force, then that will be the Lord’s own work;
He conceals the danger from the sight of the Princes; and,
owing to their blindness and rebellion, He will work such things
that methinks all Germany will be deluged with blood. We
shall ‘set ourselves like a hedge before God in favour of the land
and the people’ (Ezek. xxii. 30), in this day of His great wrath,
wherefore do you and your people pray for us.”</p>

<p>These words were addressed to an old Augustinian friend to
whom he showed himself undisguisedly and in his true colours.
In the same letter he has it that he considers it quite certain
that Carlstadt, Gabriel Zwilling and the fanatical Anabaptists
were preaching without any real call, in fact, against God’s will. To
himself he applies the words of our Redeemer: “He Whom God
has sent speaketh the words of God” (John iii. 34), and “He
that seeketh the glory of Him that sent Him is true” (John vii.
18). Fully convinced of the Divine inspiration and compulsion
he exclaims: “For this reason did I yield to necessity and
return [from the Wartburg], viz. that I might, if God wills, put
an end to this devils’ uproar” (of the fanatics).<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>If Luther sought to show the fanatics that their fruits bore
witness against them and their doctrine, it is worthy of note
that Staupitz, his former Superior, about this very time, confronted
Luther with the disastrous fruits of his action, in order
to dissuade him from the course he was pursuing. Staupitz,
who so far had been his patron, had grown apprehensive of the
character of the movement. His warning, however, only acted
as oil on the flame of the enthusiasm then surging up in Luther.
In his reply, dated in May, 1522, we find the real Luther, the
prophet full of his own great plans: “You write that my undertaking
is praised [by discreditable people], and by those who
frequent houses of ill-fame, and that much scandal has been
given by my latest writings. I am not surprised at this, neither
am I apprehensive. It is certain that we for our part have been
careful to proclaim the pure Word without causing any tumult;
the good and the bad alike make use of this Word, and this,
as you know, we cannot help.... For we do what Christ foretold
when He commanded the angels to collect and remove out
of His Kingdom all scandals. Father, I cannot do otherwise
than destroy the Kingdom of the Pope, the Kingdom of abomination
and wickedness together with all its train. God is already
doing this without us, without any assistance from us, merely
by His Word. The end of this Kingdom is come before the Lord.
The matter far exceeds our powers of comprehension.... Great
commotion of minds, great scandals and great signs must follow,
in view of God’s greatness. But, dear father, I hope this will not
trouble you; God’s plan is visible in these things and His mighty
hand. You will remember that at the outset everybody thought
my undertaking suspicious, doubtful and altogether too bad, and
yet it has held the field and will hold its own in spite of your
apprehensions; only have patience. Satan feels the smart of
his wound, and that is why he rages so greatly and sets all at
loggerheads. But Christ Who has begun the work will trample
him under foot; and the gates of hell will do their worst, but
all in vain.”</p>

<p>So perverted an application of the promise solemnly made
by Christ to the Church of Peter, that the gates of hell should
not prevail against it, had surely never before been heard.
Words such as these would even sound incredible did we not
learn from the same letter into what a state of nervous excitement
the ban and excommunication had plunged him. At Antwerp,
Jacob Probst, one of his followers, was to be burned with
two of his comrades, and in various localities Luther’s writings,
by order of the authorities, were being consigned to the flames.
This it was which made him say in his letter: “My death by
fire is already under discussion; but I only defy Satan and his
myrmidons the more that the day of Christ may be hastened,
when an end will be put to Antichrist. Farewell, father, and pray
for me.... The Evangel is a scandal to the self-righteous and
to all who think themselves wise.”<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The later occasions on which this peculiar mystic idea
asserted itself most strongly and vividly were during the
exciting events of the Peasant War of 1525; in 1528, at
the time his Evangel was in danger from the Empire, while he
was tormented within; his sojourn in the fortress of Coburg
during the much-dreaded Diet of Augsburg, in 1530, when
he again endured profound mental agony; the period of the
Schmalkald negotiations, in 1537, when the Council of Trent
had already been summoned, while Luther was suffering
much from disease; finally, in the last years of his life,
accompanied as they were by recurring friction with the
various Courts and hostile parties, when a growing bitterness
dominated his spirit.</p>

<p>In this last period of his career the sense of his Divine
mission revived in full force, never again to quit him. His
statements concerning his mission now bear a more pessimistic
stamp, but he nevertheless holds fast to it and allows
nothing to disconcert him by any suspicion of a mistake on
his part, nor does he betray any trace of his earlier doubts
and misgivings.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“We know that it is God’s cause,” he says in 1541 to the
Electoral Chancellor Brück: “God has commenced it and
carried it through, and He too will finish it! Whoever does not
wish to follow us, let him fall to the rear, with the Emperor and
the Turk; all the devils shall gain nothing here, let what God
wills befall us.”<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>“It annoys me that they should esteem these things [of the
Evangel] as though they were secular, Imperial, Turkish or
princely matters to be decided and controlled, bestowed and
accepted by reason alone. It is a matter which God and the
devil with their respective angels must arrange. Whoever does
not believe this will do no good in the business.”<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>When the negotiations at Ratisbon seemed to be exposing the
timorous Melanchthon to the “snares of Satan,” Luther in his
wonted presumptuous fashion wrote to him: “Our cause is not
to be controlled by our own action, but only by God’s Providence.
The Word progresses, prayer is ardent, hope endures, faith
conquers, so that verily we cannot but see it, and might even
sleep calmly and feast were we not so carnal; for the words of
Moses are also addressed to us: ‘The Lord will fight for you
and you shall hold your peace’ (cp. Exod. xiv. 14). It is certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
that the Lord is fighting, that He is slowly and gradually descending
from His Throne to the [Last] Judgment which we so anxiously
look for. The signs announcing the approaching Judgment are
all too numerous.... Hence put away all fear. Be strong and
glad and untroubled, for the Lord is near. Let them undertake
what they please, the Henrys [he is thinking of Henry of Brunswick,
an opponent], the bishops, and likewise the Turks and
Satan himself. We are children of the kingdom, and we await
and honour Him as our Saviour Whom these Henrys spit upon
and crucify anew.”<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>In what frame of mind he then was, and what strange judgments
he could pass, is seen even more plainly from what he adds
concerning a tract he had just published against Duke Henry of
Brunswick.</p>

<p>This work, entitled “Wider Hans Worst,” is, in style and
matter, an attack of indescribable violence on this Catholic
prince and Catholics in general. Yet Luther writes of it to
Melanchthon: “I have re-read my book against this devil, and
I cannot understand what has happened to make me so restrained.
I attribute it to my headache which prevented my mind from
being carried away on the wings of the storm.” The “bloodhound
and incendiary assassin,” as he calls the Duke, would
otherwise have had to listen to a very different song for having
compelled Luther to “waste his time on Henry’s devil’s excrement.”
That the Duke had been the originator of the appalling
number of fires which occurred in the Electorate of Hesse in
1540, both Luther and Melanchthon were firmly convinced.
Luther’s readiness to cherish the blackest suspicions, his volcanic
rage against Catholics, the pessimism of his reiterated cry:
“Let everything fall, stand or sink into ruins, as it pleases; let
things take their own course,”<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> form a remarkable accompaniment
to the thrilling tones in which he again asserts his consciousness
of the fulfilment of his Divine mission.</p></div>

<p class="p1">We must here revert to some of Luther’s Statements
concerning the triumphant progress of the Evangel and the
determined resistance to be offered to all opposing forces&mdash;solemn
declarations which attain their full meaning only in
the light of his idea of his own Divine mission. We give the
gist of the passages already quoted in detail elsewhere.
These passages, which reek of revolution, are altogether
inspired by the glowing idea of his heavenly mission apart
from which they are scarcely comprehensible.</p>

<p>“If war is to come of it, let it come,” etc. “Princely foes
are delivered up to us as a holocaust in order that they may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
be rewarded according to their works”; God will “deliver
His people even from the fiery furnace of Babylon.”<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>“Let things run on merrily and be prepared for the
worst,” “whether it be war or revolt, as God’s anger may
decree.”<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>“Let justice take its course even should the whole world
fall into ruins.”<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>“It is said, ‘If the Pope fall, Germany will perish.’<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> But
what has this to do with me?”</p>

<p>“It is God’s Word. Let what cannot stand, fall, and
what is not to remain, pass away.” “It is a great thing,”
he continues, “that for the sake of the young man [the
Divine Redeemer] this Jewish Kingdom and the Divine
Service which had been so gloriously instituted and ordered
should fall to the ground.” Not Christ alone, he says, had
spoken of His work in the same way that he (Luther) did
of his own, but St. Paul also, in spite of his grief over the
Jews, had, like himself, constantly declared: “The Word
is true, else everything must fall into ruins; for He Who
sent me and commanded me to preach, will not lie.”<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>His followers recalled his words, that it were better “all
churches, convents and foundations throughout the world
should be rooted out” than that “even one soul should be
seduced by such [Popish] error.”<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> And again: “Are we
to forswear the truth?” “Would it be strange were the
rulers, the nobles and laity to fall upon the Pope, the
bishops, priests and monks and drive them out of the land?”
They had brought it upon themselves and it was necessary
“to pray for them.”<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> But prayer might not suffice.
If no improvement took place, then “a general destruction
of all the foundations and convents would be the best
reformation.”<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>These outbursts date almost all from the time of the Diet
of Augsburg, or that immediately succeeding it. They
might, however, be compared with some earlier utterances
not one whit less full of fanaticism; for instance, where he
says to the Elector, in 1522: “Not only the spiritual but
also the secular power must yield to the Evangel, whether
willingly or unwillingly”;<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> or the opening sentences of his
“Bull of the Evening Feed of our Most Holy Lord the
Pope” (1522): “After having had to put up with so many
hawkers of bulls, cardinals ... and the countless horde
of extortioners and swindlers and knaves whom the Rhine
would hardly suffice to drown ...!”<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>A flood of rage and passionate enthusiasm for his mission
finds vent in these words: “If they hope ever to exterminate
the Turks they must begin with the Pope.”<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> “The Pope
drives the whole world from the Christian faith to his
devilish lies, so that the Pope’s rule is ten times worse than
that of the Turk for both body and soul.”<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>Previous to this, in February, 1519, he reveals in the
following words the agitation and ferment going on within
him: “I adjure you,” he says to his friend Spalatin, “if
you would think aright of the Evangel, not to imagine that
such a cause can be fought out without tumults, scandal and
rebellion. You cannot make a pen out of a sword, or peace
of war. The Word of God is a sword, war, ruin, scandal,
destruction, poison and, as we read in the Old Covenant,
‘Like to a bear in the road and a lioness in the wood,’ so it
withstands the sons of Ephraim.”<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>No Apostle or Prophet ever laid claim to a Divine
authorisation for their preaching in language so violent.
Indeed, mere phrases and extracts from his writings scarcely
suffice to give a true picture of the intensity of his prepossession
for his supposed Divine calling and of his furious
hatred of his opponents. It would, in fact, be necessary to
read in their entirety certain of his polemical works. That
they have not done so is the explanation why so many know
only a polished Luther and have scarcely an inkling of the
fierceness of the struggle which centred round his consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of a Divine mission, and of the depth of his animosity
against those who dared to gainsay him.</p>

<p>Nor was this consciousness of his without its effects on
those around him. During the long years of his public life,
it kindled the passion of thousands and contributed largely
to the Peasant Revolt and the unhappy religious wars which
followed later. Indirectly it was also productive of disaster
for the Empire by forcing it to make terms with the
turbulent elements within, and by preventing it from displaying
a united front against the Turks and other enemies
without. On the other hand, in the case of very many who
honestly looked on Luther as a real reformer of the Church,
it also served to infuse into them new enthusiasm for what
they deemed the Christian cause.</p>

<p>Its effect on Luther’s character in later life was such as
to make him, in his writings to the German people, rave like a
maniac of the different forms of death best suited for Pope
and Cardinals, viz. being hanged on the gallows with their
tongues torn out, being drowned in the Tyrrhenean Sea, or
“flayed alive.”<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> “How my flesh creeps and how my blood
boils,” he cries, after one such outburst.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>If we remember the frenzy with which he carried out his
religious enterprise, the high tension at which he ever
worked and his inexhaustible source of eloquence, it is easy
to fancy ourselves face to face with something more than
human. The real nature of the spirit which, throughout
Luther’s life, was ever so frantically at work within him,
must for ever remain a secret. One eye alone, that of the
All-seeing, can pierce these depths. Anxious Catholic
contemporaries of Luther’s strongly suspected that they
had to deal with one possessed by the evil spirit. This
opinion was openly voiced, first by Johann Nathin, Luther’s
contemporary at the Erfurt monastery, by Emser, Cochlæus,
Dungersheim and certain other early opponents, and then
by several others whose testimony will be heard later (vol. iv.,
xxvii., 1).</p>

<p>Catholic contemporaries also urged that his claim to a
Divine mission was mere impudence. A simple monk,
hitherto quite unknown to the world, so they said, breaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
his vows and dares to set himself in opposition to the
universal Church. A man, whose repute was not of the
best, and who not only lacked any higher attestation, but
actually exhibited in his doctrine of evangelical freedom, in
the disorderly lives of his followers and in the dissensions
promoted by his fanatical and stormy rhetoric, those very
signs which our Redeemer had warned His disciples would
follow false prophets&mdash;such a man, they argued, could
surely not be a reformer, but was rather a destroyer, of
Christendom; he perceives not that the Church, for all her
present abuses and corruption, has nevertheless all down
the ages scattered throughout the world the Divine blessings
committed to her care by a promise which shall never fail,
and that she will soon rise again purer and more beautiful
than ever, for the lasting benefit of mankind.</p>

<p>Luther, on the contrary, sought to base his claim to a
Divine mission on the abuses rampant in Popery, which, he
would have it, was altogether under the dominion of the
devil and quite beyond redemption.</p>

<h3>2. His Mission Alleged against the Papists</h3>

<p>Luther, subsequent to his apostasy, accustomed himself
to speak of Catholicism in a fashion scarcely credible. He
did not shrink even from the grossest and most impudent
depreciation of the Church of the Popes. His incessant
indulgence in such abuse calls for some examination into its
nature and the mental state of which it was a product.</p>

<h4><i>The Pope and the Papacy.</i></h4>

<p>The Roman Curia, Luther repeatedly declared, did not
believe one word of all the truths of religion; at the faithful
who held fast to Revelation they scoffed and called them
good simpletons (“<i>buoni cristiani</i>”); they knew nothing
either of the Creed or of the Our Father, and from all the
ecclesiastical books put together not as much could be
learnt as from one page of Martin Luther’s Catechism.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Mark this well,” he declared as early as 1520 in his work
“Von dem Bapstum tzu Rome,” of all that is ordered of God
not one jot or tittle is observed at Rome; indeed, they mock at it
as folly when anyone pays any attention to it. They don’t mind
a bit that the Gospel and the faith of Christ are perishing throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the world, and would not lift a finger to prevent it.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> The
Popes are simply “Epicureans,” so that, naturally, almost all
those who return from Rome bring back home with them an
“Epicurean faith.” “For this at least is certain, viz. that the
Pope and the Cardinals, together with their schools of knaves,
believe in nothing at all; in fact, they smile when they hear faith
mentioned.”<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>“What cares the Pope about prayer and God’s Word? He
has his own god to serve, viz. the devil. But this is a mere trifle....
What is far worse, and a real masterpiece of all the devils
in hell, is, that he usurps the authority to set up laws and articles
of faith.... He roars, as though chock-full of devils, that
whosoever does not obey him and his Romish Church cannot be
saved.... Papistically, knavishly, nay, in a truly devilish way,
does the Pope, like the stupid scoundrel he is, use the name of
the holy Roman Church, when he really means his school of
knaves, his Church of harlots and hermaphrodites, the devil’s
own hotchpotch.... For such is the language of his Romish
Church, and whoever has to do with the Pope and the Roman
See must first learn this or else he fares badly. For the devil,
who founded the Papacy, speaks and works everything through
the Pope and the Roman See.”<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>His “Heer-Predigt widder den Türcken,” in 1529, supplied
him with the occasion for the following aside: “The Pope’s
doctrine is mere spiritual murder and not one whit better than
the teaching and blasphemy of Mohammed or the Turks....
We have nothing but devils on either side and everywhere.”<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
“They even try to force us poor Christians at the point of the
sword to worship the devil and blaspheme Christ. Other tyrants
have at least this in their favour, that they crucify the Lord of
Glory ignorantly, like the Turks, the heathen and the Jews ...
but they [the Papists], say: We know that Christ’s words and
acts testify against us, but nevertheless we shall not endure His
Word, or yield to it.”<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> “I believe the Pope is the devil incarnate
in disguise; for he is Antichrist. For, as Christ is true God and
man, so Antichrist is the incarnation of the devil.”<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>“The superstition of the Pope exceeds that of the Jews.”
Though the Pope drags countless souls down to hell, yet we may
not say to him: “For shame! Why act you thus?” “Had
not his prestige been overthrown by the Word [i.e. by my preaching]
even the devil would have vomited him forth. But this
deliverance [from the Pope] we esteem a small matter and have
become ungrateful. God, however, will send other forms of
darkness to avenge this ingratitude; we still have this consolation,
that the Last Day cannot be far distant; for the prophecy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of Daniel has been entirely fulfilled, where he describes the
Papacy as though he had actually seen its doings.”<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>“At Rome,” so he assures his readers, “they pull the noses of
us German fools,” and then say, that “it is of Divine institution
that none can be made bishop without the authority of Rome.
I can only wonder that Germany ... has a farthing left for
this horde of unspeakable, intolerable Roman fools, scoundrels
and robbers.”<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> “Worse even than this rapacious seizing of the
money of foreigners is the Pope’s usurped right of deciding
matters of faith. He acts just as he pleases in accordance with
the imaginary interior inspirations which he believes he receives.”
“He does just the same as Thomas Münzer and the Anabaptists,
for he treads under foot the outward Word of God, trusts entirely
to higher illumination and gives vent to his own fond inventions
against Holy Scripture; which is the reason why we blame him.
We care not for mere human thoughts; what we want is the outward
Word.”<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>“In short, what shall I say? No error, superstition or idolatry
is too gross to be admitted and accepted; at Rome they even
honour the Pope as God. And the heathen also had a god, whose
name it was not lawful to utter.”<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p></div>

<h4><i>The Catholics.</i></h4>

<p>If we turn from the Pope-God or Pope-devil to the Papists,
from the Roman Curia to the Catholics, we find them
scourged in similar language.</p>

<p>Amidst a wealth of imagery quite bewildering to the mind,
one idea emerges clearly, viz. that he has been summoned
by God for the purpose of rebuilding Christianity from the
very foundation. Nothing but such a mission could justify
him in forcing upon himself and others the belief, that the
existing Church had been utterly corrupted by the devil
and that everybody who dared to oppose him was inspired
by Satan.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“No one can be a Papist unless he is at the very least a
murderer, robber or persecutor,” for “he must agree” that the
“Pope and his crew are right in burning and banishing people,”<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
etc. The worst thing about the Papists is the Mass; he would
rather he had “kept a brothel, or been a robber, than have
sacrificed and blasphemed Christ for fifteen years by saying
Mass.”<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Their bloodthirstiness is beyond belief. “They would not
care a scrap were no Prince or ruler left in Germany, and were
the whole land bathed in blood, so long as they were free to
exercise their tyranny and lead their godless and shameless life.”<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
So shameless is their life that the morals of the Lutherans glitter
like gold in comparison. Yea, “our life even when it reeks most
of sin is better than all their [the Papists’] sanctity, though it
should seem to smell as sweet as balsam.”<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> The Catholics had
destroyed the Baptism instituted by Christ, and replaced it by
a baptism of works, hence their doctrine is as pernicious as that
of the Anabaptists, nay, is exactly on a level with that of the
Jews.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>The Catholics profess “unbelief in God,” and “put to death
those guileless Christians who refuse to countenance such
idolatry”; they are “not fit to be compared with oxen or
asses,” seeing that they exalt “their self-chosen works,” “far
above God’s commandment. For in addition to the idolatry
and ungodly teaching whereby they daily outrage and blaspheme
God, they do not perform any works of charity towards their
neighbour, nay, would rather leave anyone to perish in want
than stretch out a hand to help him. Again, they are as careful
not to deviate by a hair’s breadth from their man-made ordinances,
rules and commands as were the Jews with regard to the Sabbath....
They make no scruple of cheating their neighbour of his
money and goods in order to fill their own belly.... Such
perverse and crazy saints, more foolish than ever ox or ass, are
all those, Mohammedans, Turks or whatever else they be called,
who refuse to listen to or receive Christ.”<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>It was Luther that Dr. Jonas had heard, on one occasion at
table, express the opinion concerning the Papists: “Young
fellows, take note of this definition: A Papist is a liar and
murderer, nay, the devil himself. Hence they are not to be
trusted, for they thirst for our blood.”<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>Luther himself assures us that “the blindness of the Papists
and the anger of God against the Papacy was terrible.” “Christians,
redeemed by the Blood of Christ, put away this blood and
worshipped the crib, surely an awful fall! If this had happened
amongst the heathen it would have been regarded as monstrous.”<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>The Catholics, Luther taught, never pray, in fact, they do not
know how to pray but only how to blaspheme. We find other
almost incredible allegations born of his fancy and voiced in a
sermon in 1524, of which we have a transcript. “They taught
the Our Father, but warned us not to use it [by instructing us
to get others to pray for us in our stead]. It is true that for
many years I shouted [’bawled,’ he says elsewhere] in the
monastery [in choir], but never did I pray. They mock the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Lord God with their prayers. Never did they approach God with
their hearts so as to pray for anything in faith.”<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>Had it been possible for a man to be saved in Popery? He,
Luther, replies that this might have happened because “some
laymen” may have “held the crucifix in front of the dying man
and said: Look up to Jesus, Who died on the cross for you.
By this means many a dying man had turned to Christ in spite of
having previously believed in the false, miraculous signs [which
the devil performs in Popery] and acted as an idolator. Such,
however, were lucky.”<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> He admits incidentally that “many of
our forefathers” had been saved in this exceptional way, though
only such as “had been led astray into error, but had not clung
to it.”<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> In any case it was a miracle. “Those pious souls,”
“many of whom had by God’s grace been wonderfully preserved
in the true faith in the midst of Popery,” had been saved, so he
fancies, in much the same way as “Abraham in Ur of the
Chaldeans, and Lot in Sodom.”<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>Now, however, matters stood differently; thanks to his
mission light had dawned again, and the unbelief of the Catholics
was therefore all the more reprehensible. In the heat of his
polemic Luther goes so far as to accuse the Papists who oppose
him of the sin against the Holy Ghost. At any rate they were
acting against their conscience, as he had pointed out before.
He also hints that theirs is that worst sin, of which Christ declares
(Matt. xii. 31), that it can be forgiven neither in this world nor
in the next. The greater part of a sermon on this text which he
preached at Wittenberg, in 1528 or 1529, deals with this criminal
blindness on the part of Catholics, this deliberate turning away
from the truth of the Holy Ghost to which Matthew refers.
Here, as elsewhere, Luther’s presupposition is: I teach “the
bright Evangel with which even they can find no fault”; I
preach “nothing but what is plain to all and so clearly grounded
on Scripture that they themselves are forced to admit it”;
“what is so plainly proved by the Holy Ghost” that it stands
out as a “truth known to all.” He proceeds: “When I was a
learned Doctor I did not believe there was such a thing on earth
as the sin against the Holy Ghost, for I never imagined or believed
it was possible to find a heart that could be so wicked.” But
“now the Papal horde” has descended to this, for they “blaspheme
and lie against their conscience”; they “are unable to
refute our Evangel or to advance anything against it,” “yet
they knowingly oppose our teaching out of waywardness and
hatred of the truth, so that no admonition, counsel, prayer or
chastisement is of any avail.” “Thus openly to smite the Holy
Ghost on the mouth,” nay, “to spit in His Face,” is to emulate
the treachery of Judas in the depth of their “obstinate and
venomous hearts”; for such it was “forbidden to pray,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>”
according to 1 John v. 16, because this would be to “insult the
spirit of grace and tread under foot the Son of God.” The
Papists richly deserve that the “Holy Ghost should forsake
them,” and that they should go “wantonly to their destruction
according to their desire.” In short, “It is better for people to
be sunk in sin, to be prostitutes and utter scamps, for at least
they may yet come to a knowledge of the truth; but these
devil’s saints who go to Divine worship full of good works, when
they hear the Holy Ghost openly testifying against them, strike
Him on the mouth and say: it is all heresy and devilry.”<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">The tone of hatred and of blind prejudice in favour of
his cause which here finds utterance may be explained to
some extent by his experience during the sharp struggles of
conscience through which he was then going, and which
formed the worst crisis of his inner states of terror. (See
vol. v., xxxii., 4.) Nor must the connection be overlooked
between his apparent confidence here and the attempt
which he makes in one passage of the sermon to justify
theologically his radical subversion of olden doctrine. The
brief argument runs as follows: “From St. Paul everyone
can infer that it cannot be achieved by works, otherwise the
Blood of Christ is made of no account.” Hence the holiness-by-works
of the Catholics was an abomination.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>On another occasion Luther, speaking of the wilful
blindness of the Catholics, declared that “God’s untold
wrath must sooner or later fall upon such Epicurean pigs
and donkeys”; the devil must be a spirit of tremendous
power to incite them “deliberately to withstand God.”
They say and admit: “‘That is, I know, the Word of God,
but even though it is the Word of God I shall not suffer it,
listen to it, nor regard it, but shall reprove it and call it
heretical, and whoever is determined to obey God in this
matter ... him I will put to death or banish.’ I could
never have believed there was such a sin.”<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p>As such declarations of the wilful obstinacy of the
Catholics are quite commonly made by him, we are tempted
to assume that such was really his opinion; if so, we are
here face to face with a remarkable instance of what his
self-deception was capable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Even at the Wartburg, however, he was already on the
road to such an idea, for, while still there, he had declared
that the Papists were unworthy to receive the truth which
he preached: “Had they been worthy of the truth, they
would long ago have been converted by my many writings.”
“If I teach them they only revile me; I implore and they
merely mock at me; I scold them and they grow angry; I
pray for them and they reject my prayer; I forgive them
their trespass and they will have none of my forgiveness;
I am ready to sacrifice myself for them and yet they only
curse me. What more can I do than Christ?”<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p>It is true that according to him the Papists were ignorant
to the last degree, and such ignorance had indeed always
prevailed under Popery. “I myself have been a learned
Doctor of theology and yet I never understood the Ten
Commandments aright. Nay, there have been many
celebrated Doctors who were not sure whether there were
nine or ten or eleven Commandments; much less did they
know anything of the Gospel or of Christ.”<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>Still, this appalling ignorance on the part of the Papists
did not afford any excuse or ground for charitable treatment.
Their malice, particularly that of the Popes, is too
great. “The Popes are a pot-boil of the very worst men on
earth. They boast of the name of Christ, St. Peter and the
Churches and yet are full of the worst devils in hell, full,
absolutely full, so full that they drivel, spew and vomit
nothing but devils.”<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>A passage in the “Table-Talk” collected by Mathesius and
recently published, shows that Luther considered his
frenzied anti-popery as the most suitable method of combating
Popish errors; “Philip [Melanchthon] isn’t as yet angry
enough with the Pope,” he said some time in the winter of
1542-43; “he is moderate by nature and always acts with
moderation, which may possibly be of some use, as he
himself hopes. But <i>my</i> storming (<i>impetus</i>) knocks the
bottom out of the cask; <i>my</i> way is to fall upon them with
clubs ... for the devil can only be vanquished by contempt.
Enough has been written and said to the weak, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
for the hardened, nothing is of any avail ... I rush in with
all my might, but against the devil.”<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">His attitude towards scholarly Catholics was very apparent
in the later episodes of his controversy with Erasmus.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>After having charged Popes and Cardinals with lack of faith,
it can be no matter for surprise that he should have represented
Erasmus as an utter infidel and a preacher of Epicureanism.
The pretexts upon which Luther based this charge had been
triumphantly demolished by Erasmus, and only Luther’s prejudice
in favour of his own mission to save Christendom from destruction
could have led him to describe Erasmus as a depraved
fellow, who personified all the infidelity and corruption of the
Papacy.</p>

<p>“This man learned his infidelity in Rome,” Luther ventured
to say of him; hence his wish “to have his Epicureanism
praised.” “He is the worst foe of Christ that has arisen for the
last thousand years.”<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> In 1519, before Erasmus took the field
against him, Luther had written to him, praising him, and, in
the hope of securing his co-operation, had said: “You are our
ornament and our hope.... Who is there into whose mind
Erasmus has not penetrated, who does not see in him a teacher,
or over whom he has not established his sway? You are displeasing
to many, but therein I discern the gifts of our Gracious
God.... With these my words, barbarous as they are, I would
fain pay homage to the excellence of your mind to which we, all
of us, are indebted.... Please look on me as a little brother
in Christ, who is wholly devoted to you and loves you dearly.”<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>On another occasion Luther abuses his opponent as follows:
“The only foundation of all his teaching is his desire to gain
the applause of the world; he weights the scale with ignorance
and malice.” “What is the good of reproaching him with being
on the same road as Epicurus, Lucian and the sceptics? By
doing so I merely succeeded in rousing the viper, and in its fury
against me it gave birth to the <i>Viperaspides</i> [i.e. the “<i>Hyperaspistes</i>”].
In Italy and at Rome he sucked in the milk of the
Lamiæ and Megæræ and now no medicine is of any avail.”
Even in what Erasmus says concerning the Creed, we see the
“<i>os et organum Satanæ</i>.” He may be compared with the enemy
in the Gospel, who, while men slept, sowed cockel in the field.
We can understand now how Sacramentarians, Donatists, Arians,
Anabaptists, Epicureans and so forth have again made their
appearance. He sowed his seed and then disappeared. And yet
he stands in high honour with Pope and Prince. “Who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
have believed that the hatred of Luther was so strong? A poor
man is made great simply through Luther.”<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>This letter Erasmus described in the title of his printed reply
as “<i>Epistola non sobria Martini Lutheri</i>.” Others, he says,
might well explain it as a mental aberration, or as due to the
influence of some evil demon.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>Luther, quite undismayed, continued to deny that Erasmus
was in any sense a believer: “He regards the Christian religion
and doctrine as a comedy or tragedy”; he is “a perfect counterfeit
and image of Epicurus”; to this “incarnate scoundrel, God&mdash;the
Father, Son and Holy Ghost&mdash;is merely ludicrous.”
“Whereas I did not take the trouble to read most of the other
screeds published against me, but merely put them to the basest
use that paper can be put&mdash;which indeed was all they were
worth&mdash;I read through the whole of the ‘<i>Diatribe</i>’ of Erasmus,
though I was often tempted to throw it aside.” He, like Democritus,
the cynical heathen philosopher, looks on our whole
theology as nothing better than a fairy tale.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">We may well be permitted to regard such statements
made by Luther in his later years concerning the Catholics
more as the result of a delusion than as deliberate falsehoods.
It may be that Luther gradually persuaded himself that
such was really the case. If this be so, we must, however,
admit with Döllinger “the unparalleled perversion and
darkening of Luther’s judgment”; this, adds Döllinger,
would explain “much in his statements which must otherwise
appear enigmatical.”<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> Considerations such as those
we have seen him (p. 121 ff.) allege concerning the truth of
his cause being proved by its success, could scarcely have
impressed any save an unsettled mind such as his. He
seems to have accustomed himself to explaining the complex
and highly questionable movement at the head of which he
stood in a light other than the true one, so much so that he
could declare: “God knows all this is not my doing, a fact
of which the whole world should have been aware long
ago.”<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> Brimful of the enthusiasm he had imbibed at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Wartburg he wrote, from Wittenberg, on June 27, 1522, in
a similar tone to Staupitz, who was then Benedictine Abbot
at Salzburg: “God has undertaken it [the destruction of
the abomination of the kingdom of the Pope] without our
help and without human aid, merely by the Word. Its end
has come before the Lord. The matter is beyond our reason
or understanding, hence it is useless to expect all to grasp it.
For the sake of God’s power it is meet and just that people’s
minds be deeply stirred and that there should be great scandals
and great signs. Dear father, do not let this disturb you;
I am hopeful. You see God’s plan in these matters and His
Mighty Hand. Remember how my cause from the outset
seemed to the world doubtful and intolerable, and how,
notwithstanding, from day to day it has gained the upper
hand more and more. It will also gain the upper hand in
what you now anticipate with misplaced apprehension;
just you wait and see. Satan feels the smart of the wound
inflicted on him, that is why he rages so furiously and throws
everything into confusion. But Christ Who began the work
will tread him under foot in defiance of all the gates of
hell.”<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p class="p2">From the very outset of his career Luther had been
paving the way for this delusion as to the true character of
his Catholic opponents, his own higher mission and God’s
overthrow of all gainsayers.</p>

<p>In 1518 he declared, as a sort of prelude to the idea of his
Divine mission, that the Catholic Doctors who opposed him
were sunk in “chaotic darkness,” and that he preached
“the one true light, Jesus Christ.”<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Even in 1517, in
publishing his Resolutions, he had said of the setting up of
his Indulgence Theses, that the Lord Himself had compelled
him to advance all this. “Let Christ see to it whether
it be His cause or mine.”<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>His pupils and Wittenberg adherents treasured up such
assurances of his extraordinary mission in order to excite
their own enthusiasm. Even Albert Dürer, who was further
removed from the sphere of his influence, spoke of him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the third decade of the century as “a man enlightened by
the Holy Ghost and one who has the Spirit of God.”<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> Long
after his death the chord which he had struck continued to
vibrate among those who were devoted to him. On his
tomb at Wittenberg might be read: “Taught by the
Divine inspiration and called by God’s Word, he disseminated
throughout the world the new light of the Evangel.” Old,
orthodox Lutheranism honoured him as God’s own messenger;
the Protestant Pietists, at the turn of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, attributed to Luther, to quote the
words of Gottfried Arnold, a truly “apostolic call,” received
by means of a “direct inspiration, impulse or Divine apprehension”;
this Divine mission, Arnold says, was “generally”
admitted, although he himself, as a staunch Pietist,
was willing to allow to Luther “the power and illumination
of the Spirit” only during the period previous to the dispute
with Carlstadt, who was equally enlightened from above.
“For a while,” says Arnold, i.e. for about seven years,
Luther was “in very truth mightily guided by God and
employed as His instrument.”<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>Other Lutheran theologians, Gerhard and Calovius, for
instance, refused to see in Luther’s case anything more than
an indirect call; about the middle of the eighteenth century
the editor of Luther’s Works, Consistorialrat Prof. J. G.
Walch, of Jena, asserted openly of Luther’s mission that
he “was not called directly by God as had been the case
with the Prophets and Apostles”; his call had only in so
far been beyond the ordinary in that “God, after decreeing
in His Divine plans the Reformation, had chosen Luther
as His tool”; hence Luther’s providential mission was
only to be inferred from the “divinity of the Reformation,”
which, however, was apparent to all who “did not wantonly
and maliciously shut their eyes to facts.” Extraordinary
gifts had not indeed been bestowed upon him by God,
though he had all the “gifts pertaining to his office” in rich
measure, and likewise the “sanctifying gifts” and the
“spiritual graces”; the latter Walch then proceeds to
dissect with painstaking exactitude.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Such a view marks the transition to the modern conception
of Luther so widely prevalent among Protestants
to-day, which, while extolling him as the powerful instrument
of the Reformation, naturalises him, so to speak, and
takes him down from the pedestal of the God-illumined
teacher and prophet, who proclaims a Divine interpretation
of Scripture binding upon all.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Apocalyptico-Mystic Vesture.</i></h4>

<p>Against Catholics Luther also used certain pseudo-mystic
elements drawn from his consciousness of a higher
mission and based principally on Holy Scripture.</p>

<p>In this respect his one-sided study of the Bible explains
much, and should avail to mitigate our judgment on him.
Stories and scenes from the Old Testament, incidents from
the heroic times of the prophets, the lives of the patriarchs,
to which he had devoted special Commentaries, so engrossed
his mind, that, unwittingly, he came to clothe all in the garb
of the prominent figures of Bible history. He was fond of
imagining himself as one of those privileged heroes living
in the same world of miracles as of yore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">If a she-ass could speak to Balaam then how much more can
he, Luther, proclaim the truth by the power from on high, even
though the whole world should be astonished at the solitary
figure who dares to stand up against it. He calls to mind, that
the prophet Elias was almost alone in refusing to bow the knee
to Baal. Discouraged by the opposition he met with from the
Catholic party he was ready to liken himself to Jeremias the
prophet, and like him to say: “We would have cured Babylon,
but she is not healed, let us forsake her.”<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>In the New Testament Christ Himself and the Apostles were
Luther’s favourite types, because, like himself, they were against
a whole world whose views were different. The fact that they
were alone did not, he says, diminish their reputation, and their
success proved their mission. Like Paul and Athanasius and
Augustine it is his duty to withstand the stream of false opinions:
“My rock, that on which I build, stands firm and will not totter
or fall in spite of all the gates of hell; of this I am certain....
Who knows what God wills to work by our means?”<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">When, at different periods of his public career, and in
preparing his various works for the press, he had occasion
to ruminate on the biblical questions connected with Antichrist,
he was wont also to consider the prophecies of Daniel
on the end of the world. By dint of a diligent comparison
of all the passages on the abominations of the latter days he
came to find therein the corruption of the Papacy fully
described, even down to the smallest details, with an
account of its overthrow, and, consequently, also of his own
mission. In the same way that he saw the impending fall
of the Turkish Empire predicted, so also he recognised that
the German Empire must shortly perish, since, as he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
learnt from Daniel, it was to receive no other constitution.
As for the Papacy, at least according to one of the most
forcible of his pronouncements, within two years “it would
vanish like smoke, together with all its swarm of parasites.”</p>

<p>In Daniel viii. we read that a king will come, “of a shameless
face, and understanding dark sentences.” He will lay
all things waste and destroy the mighty and the people of the
saints according to his will. “Craft shall be successful in
his hands and his heart shall be puffed up. He shall rise up
against the prince of princes, and shall be broken without
a hand.” His coming will be “after many days.”<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> The
king thus prophesied is generally admitted to have been
Antiochus Epiphanes, while the words “after many days”
do not refer to the Last Day or to the End of the World,
but to the latter end of the Jewish people. Luther, however,
took these words and the whole prophecy in an erroneous,
apocalyptic sense. He brought the description of the king
into connection with the passages on Antichrist, and the
great apostasy, in the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians,
the Second Epistle to Timothy and the Second Epistle of
Peter, etc.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> There seemed to him not the slightest doubt
that the Papacy, with its pernicious arrogance and revolt
against God, was here described in minutest detail.</p>

<p>This idea he finally elaborated while writing his violent
work “On the Babylonish Captivity.” He therein promised
to tell the Papists things such as they had never heard before.
This promise he fulfilled soon after in the detailed reply to
Ambrosius Catharinus, which he hastily wrote in the month
of March, 1521. In this Latin work he proved in detail to
the satisfaction of learned readers, whether in Germany or
abroad, that the Papacy was plainly depicted in the Bible
as Antichrist, and likewise its approaching great fall.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I think that, through my exposition of the Prophet Daniel,
I have carried out excellently what I promised the Papists to
do.” Thus to his friend Link, on the completion of the work.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>Daniel’s Antichrist, according to Luther’s interpretation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
assumes various shapes. These, Luther assures us, are the
different forms and masks of Romish superstition and Romish
hypocrisy. Amongst these he reckons, as the last, the Universities,
because they had made use of the Divine Word in order to deceive
the world; here he introduces the prophecy in Apocalypse ix.,
where a star falls from heaven, the fountains of the deep are
opened, locusts with the strength of scorpions rise up out of a
thick smoke, and a King reigns over them whose name is Apollyon,
or destroyer. The star Luther takes to be Thomas Aquinas, the
smoke is the empty words and opinions of Aristotle and the
philosophers, the destructive locusts are the Universities, and
Apollyon is their master, viz. Aristotle. As for Antichrist himself,
i.e. the Papacy, Jesus will destroy him with the breath of His
mouth, according to the word of St. Paul, which agrees with
the “destruction without hands” prophesied by Daniel. “Thus
the Pope and his kingdom are not to be destroyed by laymen,
although they greatly dread this [at Rome]; they are not
worthy of so mild a chastisement, but are being reserved for
the Second Coming of Christ because they have been, and still
remain, His most furious enemies. Such is the end of Antichrist,
who exalts himself above all things and does not fight with
hands, but by the breath and spirit of Satan. Breath shall
destroy breath, truth unmask deceit, for the unmasking of a lie
means bringing it to nought.”<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Apocalyptic fancies such as the above were to dog Luther’s
footsteps for the rest of his life. Both in his writings and
in his “Table-Talk” he was never backward in putting forth
his views on this abstruse subject.</p>

<p>Of the ideas concerning the Papal Antichrist which, since
Hus’s time were current among the classes hostile to Rome,<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>
Luther selected and absorbed whatever was worst. Hus’s
work on the Church he read in February, 1520. The birth
and growth of the theory in his mind even previous to this
can, however, be traced step by step, and the process affords
us a valuable insight into his mentality by revealing so well
its pseudo-mystical element.</p>

<p>We may distinguish between the earliest private and the
earliest public appearance of Luther’s idea of the Papal
Antichrist. Its first unmistakable private trace is to be
met with in a letter of December 11, 1518, to his brother-monk
and sympathiser Wenceslaus Link. Luther was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
that time labouring under the emotion incident on his
interrogation at Augsburg, of which he had just published
the “<i>Acta</i>.” Sending a copy to his friend he declares, that
his pen is already at work at much greater things, that he
knew not whence the ideas that filled his mind came, but
that he would send Link whatever writings he published,
that he might see “whether I am right in my surmise that
the real Antichrist, according to Paul [2 Thess. ii., 3 ff.], rules
at the Roman Curia.”<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> The first public expression of this
idea is, however, to be found in the pronouncement he made
subsequent to the Leipzig Disputation in the summer of
1519, viz. that if the Pope arrogated to himself alone the
power of interpreting Scripture, then he was exalting
himself above God’s Word and was worse than Antichrist.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>Not long after Luther showed how deeply he had drunk
in the ideas of Hus; in February, 1520, he confessed to
being a Husite, since both he and Staupitz too had hitherto
taught precisely Hus’s doctrine, though without having
recognised him as their leader; the plain, evangelical truth
had been burnt a hundred years before in the person of
Hus. “I am so astonished I know not what to think when
I contemplate these terrible judgments of God upon men.”<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>
On March 19 he sent to Spalatin a copy of Hus’s writing,
which had just been printed for the first time, praising the
author as a “marvel of intellect and learning.”<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>In his conception of Antichrist Luther differed from
antiquity in that he applied the term not so much to a
person as to a system, or a condition of things: the ecclesiastical
government of Rome, with its “pretensions” and its
“corruption,” appears to him in his apocalyptic dreams as
the real Antichrist. That he finally came to see in the person
of the Pope more and more an embodiment of Antichrist
was, however, only to be expected; when one wearer of
the Papal tiara died, the mask of Antichrist passed to his
successor, a matter of no difficulty since, as the end of the
world was nigh, the number of the Popes was in any case
complete.</p>

<p>As early as February 24, 1520, having previously found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
new fuel for his ire in the perusal of Hutten’s edition of
Lorenzo Valla’s dissertation against the Donation of
Constantine, he wrote to Spalatin:<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> “Nothing is too
utterly monstrous not to be acceptable at Rome;<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> of
the impudent forgery of the Donation they have made
a dogma[!]. I have come to such a pass that I can
scarcely doubt that the Pope is the real Antichrist
whom the world, according to the accepted view, awaits.
His life, behaviour, words and laws all fit the character
too well. But more of this when we meet.” The
allusion to the “accepted view” may refer to a work,
reprinted at Erfurt in 1516, and which Luther must certainly
have known, viz. the “Booklet on the Life and Rule of
End-Christ as Divinely decreed, how he corrupteth the
world through his false teaching and devilish counsel, and
how, after this, the two prophets Enoch and ‘Helyas’ shall
win back Christendom by preaching the Christian faith.”</p>

<p>Greater even than the influence of such writings, in confirming
him in his persuasion that the Pope was Antichrist,
was that of the excitement caused by his polemics. We
have already had occasion to speak of his stormy replies to
the “<i>Epitome</i>” of Silvester Prierias and the controversial
pamphlet of Augustine Alveld the Franciscan friar. In the
latter rejoinder he promises to handle the Papacy “mercilessly”
and to belabour Antichrist as he deserves. “Circumstances
demand imperatively that the veil be torn from the
mysteries of Antichrist; indeed, in their effrontery they
themselves refuse to be any longer shrouded in darkness.”
Speaking of Prierias, who was a Roman, he says: “I
believe that at Rome they have all gone stark, staring mad,
and become senseless fools, stocks, stones, devils and a
very hell”; “what now can we expect from Rome where
such a monster is permitted to take his place in the Church?”<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>
In his replies to Prierias and Alveld he depicts Antichrist
in the worst colours to be supplied by a vivid imagination
and an over-mastering fury: If such things are taught in
Rome, then “the veritable Antichrist is indeed seated in the
Temple of God, and rules in the purple-clad Babylon at
Rome, while the Roman Curia is the synagogue of Satan....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Who can Antichrist be, if not such a Pope? O Satan, Satan,
how greatly dost thou abuse the patience of thy Creator to
thine own destruction!”<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>The anger of the sensitive and excitable Wittenberg professor
had been roused by contradiction, particularly by the
tract which hailed from Rome, but the arrival of the Bull of
Excommunication moved him to the very depths of his soul
and led him to commit to writing the most hateful travesties
of the Roman Papacy.</p>

<p>In the storm and stress of the struggle, which in the latter
half of 1520 produced the so-called great Reformation works,
the Antichrist theory, in its final form, was made to serve
as a bulwark against the Papal excommunication and its
consequences. Luther drops all qualifications and henceforth
his assertions are positive. The wider becomes the
breach separating him from Rome, the blacker must he
paint his opponents in order to justify himself before the
world and to his own satisfaction. Previous to its publication
he summed up the contents of his “An den christlichen
Adel” as follows: “There the Pope is severely mauled and
treated as Antichrist.”<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> As a matter of fact, the comparison
is so startling that he could well speak of the booklet
as “a trumpet-blast against the world-destroying tyranny
of the Roman Antichrist.”<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> In the writing “On the Babylonish
Captivity,” a few weeks later, he exclaims: “Now
I know and am certain that the Papacy is the empire of
Babylon.” “The Popes are Antichrists and desire to be
honoured in the stead of Christ.... The Papacy is nothing
but the empire of Babylon and of the veritable Antichrist,
because with its doctrines and laws it merely makes sin
more plentiful; hence the Pope is the ‘man of sin’ and the
‘son of destruction.’”<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>Hereby he had prepared the way for his attack upon
Leo the Tenth’s Bull of Excommunication, which he
published in German and Latin at the end of October, 1520,
under the title, “Widder die Bullen des Endchrists” and
“<i>Adversus execrabilem Antichristi bullam</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> Such a name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
was well calculated to strike the fancy of the masses, and
there cannot be the slightest doubt that Luther welcomed
it as a taking, popular cry.</p>

<p>It is easy to meet the objection that the Papal Antichrist
was nothing more to Luther than a serviceable catchword,
and that he never meant it seriously. That such was not
the case we have abundantly proved already; on the contrary,
we have here a clear outgrowth of his pseudo-mysticism.
He ever preserved it as a sacred possession, and it
found its way in due season into the Schmalkald Articles<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
and into the Notes Luther appended to his German Bible.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>
The idea, which never left him, of the world’s approaching
end&mdash;with this we shall deal at greater length in vol. v.,
xxxi. 2&mdash;is without a doubt closely linked with his cherished
theory of his being the revealer of Antichrist and the chosen
instrument of God for averting His malice in the latter days.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">The Bible assures us, according to Luther, that, “after the
downfall of the Pope and the delivery of the poor, no one on
earth would be feared as a tyrant” (Psalm x. 18); now, he
continues, “this would not be possible were the world to continue
after the Pope’s fall, for the world cannot exist without tyrants.
And thus the prophet agrees with the Apostle that Christ at His
coming [i.e. His second coming, for the Last Judgment] will
upset the holy Roman Chair. God grant this happen speedily.
Amen.”<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p>In 1541, Luther wrote a Latin essay on the Chronology
of the World, which, in 1550, was published in German by
Johann Aurifaber under the title of “Luthers Chronica.”
This work, which witnesses both to Luther’s industry and
to his interest in history, is also made to serve its author’s
views on Antichrist. Towards the end, alluding to what he
had already said concerning the several periods of the world’s
history, he adds, that it was “to be hoped that the end
of the world was drawing near, for the sixth millenary of its
history would not be completed, any more than the three days
between Christ’s death and resurrection.” Besides, “at no
other time had greater and more numerous signs taken place,
which gives us a certain hope that the Last Day is at the very
door.”<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> Of the year <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1000 we here read: “The Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Bishop becometh Antichrist, thanks to the power of the
sword.”<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>In the same year his tireless pen, amongst other writings, produced
a Commentary on Daniel xii. concerning the “end of the
days,” the abomination of desolation and the general retribution.
The Papal Antichrist here again supplies him with abundant
exemplifications of the fulfilment of the prophecy; the signs
foretold to herald the destruction of this Empire, so hostile to
God, had almost all been accomplished, and the great day was
at hand.</p>

<p>Other people, and, among them some of the great lights of
Catholicism, both before and after Luther’s day, have erred in
their exegesis of Antichrist and been led to expect prematurely
the end of the world. Yet only in Luther do we find united a
fanatical expectation of the end with a minute acquaintance
with its every detail, scriptural demonstrations with anxious
observation of the events of the times, all steeped in the deadliest
hatred of that mortal enemy the Papacy.</p>

<p>His conviction that God was proving his mission by signs and
wonders sometimes assumed unfortunate forms, for instance,
when he superstitiously seeks its attestation in incidents of his
own day.</p>

<p>We see an example of this in the meaning he attached to the
huge whale driven ashore near Haarlem, in which he saw a sign
of God’s wrath against the Papists. “The Lord has given
them an ominous sign,” he writes, on June 13, 1522, to Speratus,
“if so be they enter into themselves and do penance. For He
has cast a sea monster called a whale, 70 feet in length and 35
feet in girth, on the shore near Haarlem. Such a monster it is
usual to regard as a certain sign of wrath. May God have mercy
on them and on us.”<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Other natural phenomena, amongst them
an earthquake in Spain, led him to write as follows to Spalatin
at the beginning of the following year: “Don’t think that I
shall creep back into a corner however much Behemoth and his
crew may rage. New and awful portents occur day by day, and
you have doubtless heard of the earthquake in Spain.”<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>When, in 1536, extraordinary deeds were narrated of a girl at
Frankfurt-on-the-Oder, and attributed to demoniacal possession
(she could, for instance, produce coins from all sorts of impossible
places, even out of men’s beards), Luther, we are told, utilised
in the pulpit these terrible signs and portents, “as a warning to
abandoned persons who deem themselves secure, in order that
now, at last, they may begin to fear God and to put their trust in
Him.”<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">At Freiberg in Saxony, towards the end of 1522, a cow
was delivered of a deformed calf. On this becoming known,
people, as was then the vogue, set about discovering the
meaning of the portent. An astrologer of Prague first took
the extraordinary phenomenon to refer to Luther, whose
hateful and wicked behaviour was portrayed in the miscarriage.
Luther, on the other hand, discovered that the
monstrosity really represented a naked calf clothed in a
cowl (the skin was drawn up into strange creases on the
back), and that it therefore indicated the monkish state, of
the worthlessness of which it was a true picture, and God’s
wrath against monasticism. In a tract published in the
spring, 1523, he compared in such detail and with such
wealth of fancy the creature to the monks that the work
itself was termed monstrous.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> The cowl represented the
monkish worship, “with prayers, Masses, chanting and
fasting,” which they perform to the calf, i.e. “to the false
idol in their lying hearts”; just as the calf eats nothing
but grass, so “they fatten on sensual enjoyments here on
earth.” “The cowl over the hind-quarters of the calf is
torn,” this signifies the monks’ “impurity”; the calf’s
legs are “their impudent Doctors” and pillars; the calf
assumes the attitude of a preacher, which means that their
preaching is despicable; it is also blind because they are
blind; it has ears, and these signify the abuse of the confessional;
with the horns with which it is provided it shall
break down their power; the tightening of the cowl around
its neck signifies their obstinacy, etc. A woodcut of the
calf helped the reader to understand the mysteries better.
To show that he meant it all in deadly earnest, he adduced
texts from Scripture which might prove how “well-grounded”
was his interpretation. He declares, that he
only speaks of what he is quite sure, and that he refrains
from a further, i.e. a prophetic, interpretation of the “Monk-Calf”
because it was not sufficiently certain, although
“God gives us to understand by these portents that some
great misfortune and change is imminent.” His hope is
that this change might be the coming of the Last Day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>“since many signs have so far coincided.” Hence his
strange delusion concerning the calf goes hand in hand with
his habitual one concerning the approaching end of the
world.</p>

<p>It would be to misapprehend the whole character of the
writing to assert, as has recently been done by an historian
of Luther, that the author was merely joking, and that what
he says of the Monk-Calf was simply a jest at the expense of
the Pope and the monks. As a matter of fact, every line of
the work protests against such a misrepresentation of the
author and his prophetic mysticism, and no one can read the
pamphlet without being struck by the entire seriousness
which it breathes.</p>

<p>The tragic earnestness of the whole is evident in the very
first pages, where Luther allows a friend to give his own
interpretation of a similar abortion (the Pope-Ass) born in
Italy. Here the writer is no other than the learned Humanist
Melanchthon, who, like Luther, with the help of a woodcut,
describes and explains the portent. Pope-Ass and
Monk-Calf made the round of Germany together, in successive
editions. Melanchthon, scholar though he was, is
not one whit less earnest in the significance he attaches to
the “Pope-Ass found dead in 1496 in the Tiber at Rome.”</p>

<p>After this double work, so little to the credit of German
literature, had frequently been reprinted, Luther, in 1535,
added two additional pages to Melanchthon’s text with a
corroboration entitled: “Dr. Martin Luther’s Amen to
the interpretation of the Pope-Ass.” He here accepts
entirely Melanchthon’s exposition, which was more than the
latter was willing to do for Luther’s interpretation of the
Monk-Calf. Melanchthon’s opinion, for which perhaps more
might be said, was that the misshapen calf stood for the
corruption of the Lutheran teaching by sensuality and
perverse doctrine, iconoclast violence and revolutionary
peasant movements.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>In his “Amen” to Melanchthon’s Pope-Ass, Luther
writes: “The Sublime, Divine Wisdom Itself” “created
this hideous, shocking and horrible image.” “Well may the
whole world be affrighted and tremble.” “People are
terrified if a spirit or devil appears, or makes a clatter in a
corner, though this is but mere child’s play compared with
such an abomination, wherein God manifests Himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
openly and shows Himself so cruel. Great indeed is the
wrath which must be impending over the Papacy.”<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">In his Church-postils Luther spoke of the “Pope-Ass” with
an earnestness calculated to make a profound impression upon
the susceptible. He referred to the “dreadful beast which the
Tiber had cast up at Rome some years before, with an ass’s head,
a body like a woman’s, an elephant’s foot for a right hand, with
fish scales on its legs, and a dragon’s head at its rear, etc. All
this signified the Papacy and the great wrath and chastisement
of God. Signs in such number portend something greater than
our reason can conceive.”<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>As Luther makes such frequent use of the Pope-Ass, which he
was instrumental in immortalising, for instance, in the frightful
abuse of the Pope contained in “Das Bapstum zu Rom vom
Teuffel gestifft,”<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> and also circulated a woodcut of it in his book
of caricatures of the Papacy, adding some derisive verses,<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
which woodcut was afterwards reproduced from this or the
earlier publication by other opponents of the Papacy, both in
Germany and abroad,<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> some particulars concerning the previous
history of the Pope-Ass may here not be out of place.</p>

<p>The dead beast was said to have been left stranded on the
banks of the Tiber in January, 1496, under the pontificate of
Pope Alexander VI., when Italy was in a state of great distress.
The find made a profound impression, as was only to be expected
in those days of excitement and superstition; it was greatly
exaggerated, and, at an early date, interpreted in various ways.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
The oldest description is to be met with in the Venetian Annals
of Malipiero, where the account is that given by the ambassador
of the Republic at Rome.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> The monster was also portrayed in
stone in the Cathedral of Como, as an omen, so it would seem, of
the misfortunes of the day, and of those yet to be expected.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>
At Rome itself political opponents of Alexander VI. made use of
it in their campaign against a Pope they hated, by circulating a
lampoon&mdash;the oldest extant&mdash;containing a caricature of the
event. A facsimile of this cut has come down to us in the shape
of a copper plate made in 1498 by Wenzel of Olmütz.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> In all
likelihood a copy of this very plate was sent to Luther at the
beginning of 1523 by the Bohemian Brethren.</p>

<p>Melanchthon and Luther diverged in their use of this picture
from the older and more harmless interpretation, i.e. that which
saw in it a reference to earthly trials, or a judgment on the
politics of the Pope. They, on the contrary, regarded it as a
denunciation by heaven of the Papacy itself and of the Roman
Church with all its “abominations.” Quite possibly the transition
had been quietly effected by the Bohemian Brethren. Luther,
however, says Lange, “was the first to make it public property.”
“The Pope-Ass is for this reason the most interesting example
of the whole teratological literature, because in it we can see the
transition visibly effected.” The same author detects in the
joint work of the two Wittenbergers “a polemical tone hitherto
unheard of”; of Melanchthon’s Pope-Ass, he says: “It is
probably the most unworthy work we have of Melanchthon’s.
He himself naturally believed implicitly in what he wrote....
That Melanchthon acquitted himself of his task with particular
skill cannot be affirmed.”<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p>Just as the Monk-Calf had been applied to Luther himself
previous to his own polemical interpretation of it, so, after the
appearance of his and Melanchthon’s joint publication, both
the Calf and the Ass were repeatedly taken by the Catholic
controversialists to represent Luther and his innovations. The
sixteenth century, as already hinted, loved to dwell upon and
expound such freaks of nature. Authors of repute had done so
before Luther, at least to the extent of making such the subject
of indifferent compositions, as the poet J. Franciscus Vitalis of
Palermo had done (“<i>De monstro nato</i>”) in the case of a monstrosity
said to have been born at Ravenna in 1511 or 1512;
the Humanist Jacob Locher, at the turn of the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries, dealt with a similar case in his “<i>Carmen
heroicum</i>.” Conrad Lycosthenes published at Basle, in 1557, a
compendium of the prodigies of nature (“<i>Prodigiorum ac ostentorum
chronicon</i>”), in which he instances a large number of such
freaks famous even before Luther’s day. Of the earlier Humanists
Sebastian Brant composed some Elegies on the Marvels of Nature.
The Wittenberg work on the Calf and Ass must be put in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
proper setting, and judged according to the standard of its age;
although, owing to its religious bias, it far exceeds in extravagance
anything that had appeared so far, it nevertheless was an outgrowth
of its time.</p></div>


<h3>3. Proofs of the Divine Mission. Miracles and Prophecies</h3>

<p>How was Luther to give actual proof of the reality of his
call and of his mission to introduce such far-reaching
ecclesiastical innovations?</p>

<p>Luther himself, indirectly, invited his hearers to ask this
question concerning his calling. “Whoever teaches anything
new or strange” must be “called to the office of preacher”
he frequently declares of those new doctrines which differed
from his own; no one who has not a legitimate mission will
be able to withstand the devil, but on the contrary will be
cast down to hell.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Even in the case of the ordinary and
regular office, Luther demands a legitimate mission; for the
office of extraordinary messenger of God, he is still more
severe. For here it is a question of the extraordinary preaching
of truths previously unknown or universally forgotten
or questioned, and of the reintroduction of doctrine. Here
he rightly requires that whoever wishes to introduce anything
new or to teach something different from the common,
must be able to appeal to miracles in support of his vocation.
If he is unable to do this, let him pack up and depart.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>
Elsewhere, as he correctly puts it: “Where God wills to
alter the ordinary ways, He ever performs miracles.”<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> (Cp.
vol. i., p. 225 f.)</p>

<p>His teaching is, “There are two sorts of vocations to the
office of preacher”; one takes place without any human
means by God alone [the extraordinary call], the other [the
ordinary] is effected by man as well as by God. The first is
not to be credited unless attested by miracles such as were
performed by Christ and His Apostles. Hence, if they come
and say God has called them, that the Holy Ghost urges
them, and they are forced to preach, let us ask them boldly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
“What signs do you perform that we may believe you?”<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>
(Mark xvi. 20). Logically enough Luther also demanded
miracles of Carlstadt, Münzer and the Anabaptists.</p>

<p>Which of the two kinds of vocation must we see in Luther’s
case? Was his the ordinary one, which keeps to the well-trodden
path, or the extraordinary one, which “strikes out
a new way”? Simple as the question appears, it is nevertheless
difficult to give a straight answer in Luther’s own
words.</p>

<p>As has been proved by Döllinger in his work on the
Reformation, and as was well seen even by earlier polemical
writers, Luther’s statements concerning his own mission
were not remarkable for consistency. No less than fourteen
variations have been counted, though, naturally, they do
not involve as many changes of opinion.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> We shall be
nearest to the truth if we assume his mission to have been
an extraordinary and unusual one. As an ordinary one
it certainly could not be regarded, seeing the novelty of his
teaching, and that he himself, as “Evangelist by God’s
Grace” (see vol. iv., xxvi., 4), professed to be introducing a
doctrine long misunderstood and forgotten. Besides, an
ordinary call could only have emanated from the actually
existing ecclesiastical authorities, with whom Luther had
altogether broken. In this connection Luther himself, on
one occasion, comes surprisingly near the Catholic view
concerning the right of call invested in the bishops as the
successors of the Apostles, and declares that “not for a
hundred thousand worlds would he interfere with the office
of a bishop without a special command.”<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>The assumption of an extraordinary call offers, however,
an insuperable difficulty which cannot fail to present itself
after what has been said. No extraordinary attestation on the
part of heaven is forthcoming, nor any miracle which might
have confirmed Luther’s doctrine; God’s witness on behalf
of His messenger by signs or prophecies, such as those of
Christ, of the Apostles and of many of the Saints, was
lacking in Luther’s case, and so was that sanctity of life
to be expected of a divinely commissioned teacher whose
mission it is to bring men to the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>No one now believes in the existence of any actual and
authentic miracle performed by Luther, or in any real
prophecy, whether about or by him. With the tales of
miracles which once found favour among credulous Pietists,
history has no concern. Though here and there some
credence still attaches to the alleged prediction of Hus,
which Luther himself appealed to,<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> viz. that after the goose
(Hus=goose) would come a swan, yet historical criticism
has already dealt quite sufficiently with it. We should run
the risk of exposing Luther to ridicule were we to enumerate
and reduce to their real value the alleged miracles by which,
for instance, he was convinced his life was preserved in the
poisoned pulpits of the Papists, or the various “<i>monstra</i>”
and “<i>portenta</i>” which accompanied his preaching. Of such
prodigies the Pope-Ass and the Monk-Calf are fair samples
(above, p. 148 ff.).<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>In reply to the attempts made, more particularly in the
days of Protestant orthodoxy in the sixteenth century, to
compare the rapid spread of Protestantism with the miracle
of the rapid propagation of Christianity in early days, it has
rightly been pointed out, that the comparison is a lame one;
the Church of Christ spread because her moral power enabled
her to impose on a proud world mysteries which transcend
all human reason; on a world sunk in every lust and vice
a moral law demanding a continual struggle against all the
passions and desires of the heart; her conquest of the world
was achieved without secular aid or support, in fact, in the
very teeth of the great ones of the earth who for ages
persecuted her; yet during this struggle she laid her foundations
in the unity of the one faith and one hierarchy; her
spread, then, was truly miraculous.</p>

<p>Luther, on the other hand, so his opponents urged, by his
opposition to ecclesiastical authority and his principle of the
free interpretation of Scripture, was casting humility to the
winds and setting up the individual as the highest authority
in matters of religion; thanks to his “evangelical freedom”
he felt justified in deriding as holiness-by-works much that
in Christianity was a burden or troublesome; on the other
hand, by his doctrine of imputation, he cast the mantle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Christ’s righteousness over all the doings and omissions of
believers; from the very birth of his movement he had
sought his principal support in the favour of the Princes,
whom, in due course, he invested with supreme authority in
the Church; the spread of Lutheranism was not the spread
of a united Church, but, on the contrary, such was the
diversity of opinions that Jacob Andreæ, a Protestant
preacher, could say, in 1576, in a public address, that it
would be difficult to find a pastor who held the same faith as
his sexton.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> From all this the Church’s sixteenth-century
apologists concluded that the spread of Luther’s teaching
was not at all miraculous.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Concerning the miracle spoken of above, and miracles in general
as proofs of the truth, Luther expresses himself in the third
sermon on the Ascension, embodied in his Church-postils. The
occasion was furnished by the words of Our Lord: “These signs
shall follow those who believe” (Mark xvi. 17), and by the
pertinent question addressed to him by the fanatics and other
opponents: Where are your miracles?</p>

<p>With remarkable assurance he will have it, that to put such a
question to him was quite “idle”; miracles enough had taken
place when Christianity was first preached to make good the
words spoken by Our Lord; at the present day the Gospel had
no further need of them; such outward signs had been suitable
“for the heathen,” whereas, now, the Gospel had been “proclaimed
everywhere.”&mdash;He does not see that though the Gospel had
certainly been proclaimed everywhere this was was not his own
particular Gospel or Evangel, and that he is therefore begging
the question. He continues quite undismayed: Miracles may
nevertheless take place, and do, as a matter of fact, occur
under the Evangel, for instance, the driving out of devils and the
healing of sicknesses. “The best and greatest miracle” is,
however, the spread and preservation of my doctrine in spite of
the assaults of devils, tyrants and fanatics, in spite of flesh and
blood, of the “Pope, the Turk and his myrmidons.” Is it no
miracle, that “so many die cheerfully in Christ” in this faith?
Compared with this miracle, declares the orator, those miracles
which appeal to the senses are mere child’s play; this is a
“miracle beyond all miracles”; well might people be astonished
at the survival of his doctrine “when a hundred thousand devils
were striving against it.” It was only to be expected that this
miracle should be blasphemed by an unbelieving world, but
“were we to perform the most palpable miracles, they would
still despise them.” This is why God does not work them
through us, just as Christ Himself, although able to perform
miracles with the greatest ease, once refused to give the Jews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
“any other sign than that of the Prophet Jonas,” i.e. the resurrection.
Luther concludes with an explanation of Christ’s
refusal and of the miracle of Jonas.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Hence he is willing to allow the absence of “palpable
miracles” in support of his Evangel, in default of which,
however, he instances the miracle of his great success. And
yet, according to his own showing, such an attestation by
palpable miracles would have been eminently desirable.
Germany, he says, from the early days of her conversion
down to his own time, had never been in possession of
Christianity, because the real Gospel, i.e. the doctrine of
Justification, had remained unknown. Only now for the
first time had the Gospel been revealed in all its purity,
thanks to his study of Scripture.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> At the Council of Nicæa
he declares, “there was not one who had even tasted of the
Divine Spirit”; even the Council of the Apostles at
Jerusalem was not above suspicion, seeing that it had seen
fit to discuss works and traditions rather than faith.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>Thus he requires that his unheard-of claims, albeit not
attested by any display of miracles, should be accepted
simply on his own assurance that his teaching was based on
Holy Scripture. “There is no need for us to work wonders,
for our teaching is already confirmed [by Holy Scripture]
and is no new thing.”<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>Owing to the lack of any Divine attestation, Luther often
preferred to describe his mission as an ordinary one. In this
case he derives his vocation to teach from his degree of
Doctor of Theology and from the authority given him by
the authorities to preach. “I, Dr. Martin,” he says, for
instance, speaking of his doctorate, “was called and compelled
thereto; for I was forced to become a Doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
[of Holy Scripture] against my will and simply out of
obedience.”<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> Elsewhere, however, he declares that the
doctorate was by no means sufficient to enable one to bid
defiance to the devil, or to equip a man in conscience for the
task of preaching.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> He was still further confirmed in this
belief when he realised that he owed his doctorate to that
very Church which he represented as the Kingdom of Antichrist
and a mere Babylon. He himself stigmatised his
degree as the “mark of the Beast,” and rejoiced that the
excommunication had cancelled this papistical title.</p>

<p>Neither could the want of a call be supplied by the
authorisation of the Wittenberg Council, upon which at times
Luther was wont to lay stress. He himself hesitated to
allow that magistrates or Princes could give a call, particularly
where the teaching of any of those thus appointed
by the magistrates ran counter to his own. Even though
their teaching agreed entirely with the views of the secular
authorities, their mission was in his eyes quite invalid. He
even had frequent cause to complain, that the Evangel was
greatly hampered by the interference of the secular authorities
and by their sending out as preachers those who had no
real call, and were utterly unfitted for the office.</p>

<p>After what has gone before, we can readily understand
how Luther came to pass over in silence the question of his
mission and to appeal directly to his preaching of the truth
as the sign of his vocation; he does not seem to have
perceived that the main point was to establish a criterion
for the recognition of the truth, short of which anyone would
be at liberty to set up his pet error as the “truth.” “The
first,” though not the only condition, was, he declared,
“that the preacher should have an office, be convinced
that he was called and sent, and that what he did was done
for the sake of his office”; seeing, however, that even the
Papists fulfilled these conditions, Luther usually required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
in addition that the preachers “be certain they have God’s
Word on their side.”<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p>In 1522 he declared any questioning of his vocation to
be mere perversity, for, of his call, no creature had a right
to judge. We cannot but quote again this assurance, “My
doctrine is not to be judged by any man, nor even by the
angels; because I am certain of it, I will judge you and the
angels likewise, as St. Paul says (Gal. i. 8), and whosoever
does not accept my teaching will not arrive at blessedness.
For it is God’s and not mine, therefore my judgment is God’s
and not mine.”<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p>Such statements are aids to the understanding of his
mode of thought, but there are other traits in his mental
history relating to the confirmation of his Divine calling.</p>

<p>Such, for instance, is his account of the miracles by which
the flight of certain nuns from their convents was happily
accomplished.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">The miracle which was wrought on behalf of the nun Florentina,
and in confirmation of the new Evangel, is famous. Luther
himself, in March, 1524, published the story according to the
account given by the nun herself, and dedicated it to Count
Mansfeld.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> As this circumstance, and also the Preface, shows,
he took the matter very seriously, and was entirely persuaded
that it was a visible “sign from heaven.” Yet it is perfectly
plain, even from his own pamphlet, that the occurrence was
quite simple and natural.</p>

<p>Florentina of Upper-Weimar had been confided in early
childhood to the convent of Neu-Helfta, at Eisleben, to be
educated; later, after the regulation “year of probation,” she
took the vows, probably without any real vocation. Having
become acquainted with some of the writings of the Reformers,
she entered into correspondence with Luther, and, one happy
day in February, 1524, thanks to “visible, Divine assistance,”
escaped from her fellow-nuns&mdash;who, so she alleged, had treated
her cruelly&mdash;because, as she very naively remarks,<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> “the person
who should have locked me in left the cells open.” She betook
herself to Luther at Wittenberg. Luther adds nothing to the
bare facts; he has no wish to deceive the reader by false statements.
Yet, speaking of the incident, he says in the Introduction:
“God’s Word and Work must be acknowledged with fear, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
... may His signs and wonders be cast to the winds.” Godless
people despised God’s works and said: This the devil must have
done. They did not “perceive God’s action, or recognise the work
of His Hands. So is it ever with God’s miracles.” Just as the
Pharisees disregarded Christ’s driving out of devils and raising
of the dead, and only admitted those things to be miracles which
they chose to regard as such, so it is still to-day. Hence no heed
would be paid to this work of God by which Florentina “had been
so miraculously rescued from the jaws of the devil.” If noisy
spirits, or Papists with their holy water, performed something
extraordinary, then, of course, that was a real miracle. He
proceeds: “But we who, by God’s Grace, have come to the
knowledge of the Evangel and the truth, are not at liberty to
allow such signs, which take place for the corroboration of the
Evangel, to pass unnoticed. What matters it that those who
neither know, nor desire to know, the Evangel do not recognise it
as a sign, or even take it for the devil’s work?”<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>The use of an argument so puerile, and Luther’s confident
assumption of an extraordinary interference of Divine Omnipotence
suspending the laws of nature (which is what a miracle
amounts to), all this could only arouse painful surprise in the
minds of those of his readers who were faithful to the Church.
Luther was here the victim of a mystical delusion only to be
accounted for by his dominant idea of his relation to God and
the Church.</p>

<p>When, in the same work, he goes on to tell his readers that:
“God has certainly wrought many similar signs during the last
three years, which shall be described in due season”; or that
he merely recounted Florentina’s escape to Count Mansfeld as
“a special warning from God” against the nunneries, which
“God had made manifest in their own country,” we see still
more plainly the extent and depth of his pseudo-mystical views
concerning the miracles wrought on behalf of his Evangel.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Concerning his own ability to work miracles, he is reticent
and cautious. It is true that, to those who are ready to
believe in him, he confidently promises God’s wonderful
intervention should the need arise; the miraculous power,
so far as it concerns himself, he represents, however, as
bound by a wise economy, and, also, by his own desire of
working merely through the Word.</p>

<p>It should be noted of the statements to be quoted that
they betray no trace of having been made in a jesting or
rhetorical mood, but are, on the contrary, in the nature of
theological arguments.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">In 1537, he declared: “I have frequently said that I never
desired God to grant me the grace of working miracles, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
rejoice that it is given to me to hold fast to the Word of God and
to work with it; otherwise they would soon be saying: ‘The
devil works through him.’” For, as the Jews behaved towards
Christ, “so also do our adversaries, the Papists, behave towards
us. Whatever we do is wrong in their eyes; they are annoyed
at us and scandalised and say: The devil made this people.
But they shall have no sign from us.” All that Christ said to the
Jews was: “Destroy this temple,” that is, Me and My teaching;
I shall nevertheless rise again. “What else can we reply to our
foes, the Papists?... Destroy the temple if you will, it shall
nevertheless be raised up again in order that the Gospel may
remain in the Christian Church.”<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>&mdash;The great miracle required
of Christ was merely deferred, He performed it by His actual
resurrection from the dead. What sign such as this was it in
Luther’s power to promise?</p>

<p>Luther is even anxious not to have any signs. “I have
besought the contrary of God,” i.e. that there should be no
revelations or signs, so he writes in 1534, in the enlarged Commentary
on Isaias, “in order that I may not be lifted up, or
drawn away from the spoken Word, by the deceit of Satan.”<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>&mdash;“Now
that the Gospel has been spread abroad and proclaimed
to the whole world it is not necessary to work wonders as in the
time of the Apostles. But should necessity arise and the Gospel
be threatened and suffer violence, we should then have to set
about it and work signs rather than leave the Gospel to be
abused and oppressed. But I hope it will not be necessary, and
that things will not come to such a pass as to compel me to
speak with new tongues, for this is not really necessary.” Here
he is thinking of believers generally, though at the close he
refers more particularly to himself. Speaking of all, he continues
prudently: “Let no one take it upon himself to work wonders
without urgent necessity.” “For the disciples did not perform
them on every occasion, but only in order to bear witness to the
Word and to confirm it by miraculous signs.”<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>That he believed the power to work miracles might be obtained
of God may be inferred from many of his declarations
against the fanatics, where he challenges them to prove themselves
the messengers of God by signs and wonders; for whosoever
is desirous of teaching something new or uncommon, he had
said, must be “called by God and able to confirm his calling by
real miracles,” otherwise let him pack up and go his way.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> But
his own doctrines were an entirely new thing in the Church, and,
in spite of every subterfuge, when thus inviting others to perform
miracles, he cannot always have been unmindful of the fact.
Hence it has been said that he claimed a certain latent ability to
work miracles. It should, however, be noted that he always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
insists here that his teaching, unlike that of the fanatics and
other sects, Catholics included, was not new, but was the original
teaching of Christ, and that therefore it stood in no need of
miracles.</p>

<p>Still, his confident tone brings him within measurable distance
of volunteering to work miracles in support of his cause. “Although
I have wrought no such sign such as perhaps we might
work, should necessity arise,” etc.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> These words are quite in
keeping with the above: “We should have to set about it,”
etc.</p>

<p>It is strange how Luther repeatedly falls back on Melanchthon’s
recovery at Weimar in 1540. This eventually followed a visit of
Luther to his friend, to encourage and pray for the sick man,
whose health had completely broken down under the influence
of melancholy.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> It is possible Luther saw in this a miraculous
answer to his prayer; owing to the manner in which he recounted
the incident it became a tradition, that the power of
his prayer was stronger than the toils of death. Walch, in his
Life of Luther, wrote, that people had then seen “how much
Luther’s prayer was capable of.”<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>The same scholar adds, as another “remarkable example,”
that that godly and upright man, Frederick Myconius, the first
evangelical Superintendent at Gotha, had assured him before
his death, that only thanks to Luther’s prayers had he been able
to drag on his existence, notwithstanding his consumption, for
six years, though in a state of “great weakness.”<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> In cheering
up Myconius, and promising him his prayers, Luther had said:
As to your recovery, “I demand it, I will it, and my will be
done. Amen.”<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> “In the same way,” Walch tells us, “he also
prayed for his wife Catharine when she was very ill; he was
likewise reported to have said on one occasion: ‘I rescued our
Philip, my Katey and Mr. Myconius from death by my prayers.’”<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">How does the case stand as regards the gift of prophecy,
seeing that Luther apparently claims to have repeatedly
made use of higher prophetic powers?</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">On more than one occasion Luther declares that what he predicted
usually came to pass, even adding, “This is no joke.” In
the same way he often says quite seriously, that he would refrain
from predicting this or that misfortune lest his words should be
fulfilled. We see an instance of this sort in his circular-letter
addressed, in February, 1539, to the preachers on the anticipated
religious war.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p>“I am a prophet of evil and do not willingly prophesy anything,
for it generally comes to pass.” This he says in conversation when
speaking of the wickedness of Duke George of Saxony.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> In the
Preface to John Sutel’s work on “The Gospel of the Destruction
of Jerusalem,” Luther says, in 1539, speaking of the disasters
which were about to befall Germany: “I do not like prophesying
and have no intention of doing so, for what I prophesy, more
particularly the evil, is as a rule fulfilled, even beyond my expectations,
so that, like St. Micheas, I often wish I were a liar and false
prophet; for since it is the Word of God that I speak it must
needs come to pass.”<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> In his Church-postils he commences a
gloomy prophecy on the impending fate of Germany with the
words: “From the bottom of my heart I am loath to prophesy,
for I have frequently experienced that what I predict comes
only too true,” the circumstances, however, compelled him, etc.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

<p>No wonder then that his enthusiastic disciples had many
instances to relate of his “prophecies.”</p>

<p>A casual reference of Luther’s to a seditious rising to be
expected among the German nobility, is labelled in the MS. copy
of Lauterbach’s “Tagebuch,” “Luther’s Prophecy concerning
the rising of the German nobles.”<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> Bucer in his Eulogies on
Luther in the old Strasburg Agenda, after mentioning his great
gifts, says: “Add also the gift of prophecy, for everything
happens just as he foretold it.” This we read in a Leipzig publication,<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>
in which, as an echo of the Reformation Festivities of 1717,
a Lutheran, referring to the General Superintendent of Altenburg,
Eckhard, protests, “that Luther both claimed and really possessed
the gift of prophecy.” Mathesius, in his 15th Sermon on
Luther, speaks enthusiastically of the latter’s prophecy against
those of the new faith who were sapping the foundations of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Wittenberg teaching: “In our own day Dr. Martin’s prayers and
prophecies against the troublesome and unruly spirits have, alas,
grown very powerful ... they were to perish miserably, a
prophecy which I heard from his own lips: ‘Mathesius, you
will see what wanton attacks will be made upon this Church and
University of Wittenberg, and how the people will turn heretics
and come to a frightful end.’”<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>

<p>Even J. G. Walch,<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> in 1753, at least in the Contents and Indices
to his edition of Luther’s Works, quotes as “Luther’s Prophecies
on the destruction of Germany,” the passage from the German
“Table-Talk”<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> which foretells God’s judgments on Germany where
His Evangel was everywhere despised. Yet this “prophecy”
is nothing more than a natural inference from the confusion which
Luther saw was the result of his work. In the same Indices,
under the name “Luther,”<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> we again find given as a “prophecy”
this prediction concerning Germany, under the various forms in
which Luther repeated it. Lastly, under the heading “Prophecy,”
further reference is made to his predictions on the future lamentable
fate of his own Evangel; on the distressing revival by his
preachers of the doctrine of good works which he had overthrown;
on the apostasy of the most eminent Doctors of the Church; on
the abuse of his books by friends of the Evangel; on the Saxon
nobles after the death of Frederick the Elector,<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> and, finally, on
the fate of Wittenberg.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>&mdash;In all this there is, however, nothing
which might not have been confidently predicted from the
existing state of affairs. Walch prefaces his summary with the
words: “For Luther’s teaching is verily that faith and doctrine
proclaimed by the prophets from the beginning of the world,”
just as Luther himself had once said in a sermon, that his doctrine
had “been proclaimed by the patriarchs and prophets five
thousand years before,” but had been “cast aside.”<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>

<p>We can understand his followers, in their enthusiasm, crediting
him with a true gift of prophecy, but it is somewhat difficult to
believe that he himself shared their conviction. Although the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
belief of his disciples can be traced as clearly to Luther’s own
assurances, as to the fulfilment of what he predicted, yet it is
uncertain whether at any time his self-confidence went to this
length. Whoever is familiar with Luther’s mode of speech and
his habit of talking half in earnest half in jest, will have some
difficulty in persuading himself that the disciples always distinguished
the shade of their master’s meaning. The disasters
imminent in Germany, and the religious wars, might quite well
have been foreseen by Luther from natural signs, and yet this is
just the prophecy on which most stress is laid. Melanchthon, who
was more sober in his judgments in this respect, speaks of Luther
as a prophet merely in the general sense, as for instance when he
says in his Postils: “Prophets under the New Law are those
who restore again the ancient doctrine; such a one was Dr.
Martin Luther.”<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>“What Luther, the new Elias and Paul, has prophesied cannot
but come true,” writes a preacher in 1562, “and those who
would doubt this are unbelieving and godless, Papists, Epicureans,
Sodomites or fanatics. Everything has become so frightful and
bestial, what with blasphemy, swearing, cursing, unchastity and
adultery, usury, oppression of the poor and every other vice, that
one might fancy the last trump was sounding for the Judgment.
What else do the countless, hitherto unheard-of signs, wonders
and visions indicate, but that Christ is about to come to judge
and punish?”<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Luther was most diligent in collecting and making use of
any prophetical utterances which might go to prove the
exalted character of his mission.</p>

<p>The supposed prophecy of Hus, that from his ashes would
arise a swan whose voice it would be impossible to stifle, he
coolly applied to himself.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> He was fond of referring to
what a Franciscan visionary at Rome had said of the time
of Leo X.: “A hermit shall arise and lay waste the Papacy.”
Staupitz, he says, had heard this prophecy from the mouths
of many at the time of his stay in Rome (1510). He himself
had not heard it there, but later he, like Staupitz, had come
to see that he “was the hermit meant, for Augustinian
monks are commonly called hermits.”<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Luther had also learnt that a German Franciscan named
Hilten, who died at Eisenach about the end of the fifteenth
century, had predicted much concerning the destruction of
monasticism, the shattering of Papal authority and the
end of all things. So highly were Hilten’s alleged sayings
esteemed in Luther’s immediate circle that Melanchthon
placed one of them at the head of the Article (27) “On
monastic vows,” in his theological defence of the Confession
of Augsburg; “In 1516 a monk shall come, who will
exterminate you monks; ... him will you not be able
to resist.”<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> Luther, before this, on October 17, 1529, by
letter, had urged his friend Frederick Myconius of Gotha to
let him know everything he could about Hilten, “fully,
entirely and at length, without forgetting anything”; “you
are aware how much depends upon this.... I am very
anxious for the information, nay, consumed with longing
for it.”<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> His friend’s report, however, did not bring him all
he wanted.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> The Franciscan had predicted the fall of Rome
about 1514, i.e. too early, and the end of the world for 1651,
i.e. too late. Hence we do not hear of Luther’s having brought
forward the name of this prophet in support of his cause.
Only on one occasion does he mention Hilten as amongst
those, who “were to be consigned to the flames or otherwise
condemned.” The fact is that this monk of Eisenach,
once an esteemed preacher, was never “condemned” or
even tried by the Church, although Luther in the above
letter to Myconius says that he “died excommunicate.”
Hilten died in his friary, fortified with the Sacraments, and
at peace with the Church and his brother monks, after
beseeching pardon for the scandal he had given them. The
Franciscans had kept in custody the unfortunate man, who
had gone off his head under the influence of astrology and
apocalyptic dreams, in order that his prophecies might not
do harm in the Church or the Order. He was not, however,
imprisoned for life, still less was he immured, as some have
said; he was simply kept under fatherly control (“<i>paterne
custoditum</i>”), that those of his brethren who believed in
him might not take any unfair advantage of the old man.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>In the widely read new edition of the book of Prophecies
by Johann Lichtenberger, astrologer to the Emperor
Frederick III. (1488), republished by Luther in 1527 with a
new Preface, the latter’s ideas play a certain part. Luther
did not regard these Prophecies as a “spiritual revelation”;
they were merely astrological predictions, as he says in the
Preface,<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> views which might often prove to be questionable
and faulty; nevertheless, his “belief” is “that God does
actually make use of heavenly signs, such as comets, eclipses
of the sun and the moon, etc., to announce impending misfortune
and to warn and affright the ungodly.”<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> “I myself
do not scorn this Lichtenberger in everything he says, for he
has come right in some things.”<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> Luther is principally
concerned with the chastisements predicted by Lichtenberger,
but not yet accomplished&mdash;as the “priestlings”
rejoiced to think&mdash;but, still to overtake them owing to their
hostility to the Lutheran teaching. “Because they refuse to
amend their impious life and doctrine, but on the contrary
persevere in it and grow worse, I also will prophesy that in a
short time their joy shall be turned to shame, and will ask
them kindly to remember me then.”<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> Later he speaks
incidentally of Lichtenberger as a “fanatic, but still one
who had foretold many things, for this the devil is well
able to do.”<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>During his stay at the Wartburg he had occasion to reflect
on the ancient prophecy concerning an Emperor Frederick,
who should redeem the Holy Sepulchre. He was inclined to
see in this Frederick, his Elector, whose right hand he himself
was. The difficulty that the Elector was not Emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
did not appear to him insuperable, since at Frankfurt the
votes of the other electors had been given to Frederick, so
that he might have been “a real emperor had he so desired.”
Still, he was loath to insist upon such an artifice; this
solution of the difficulty might, he says, be termed mere
child’s play. What is much clearer to him is, that the Holy
Sepulchre of the prophecy is “the Holy Scripture wherein
the truth of Christ lies buried, after having been put to death
by the Papists.... As for the actual tomb in which the
Lord lay and which is now in the hands of the Saracens, God
cares no more about it than about the Swiss cows. But no
one can deny that amongst you, under Duke Frederick,
Elector of Saxony, the living truth of the Gospel has shone
forth.”<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">GLIMPSES OF A REFORMER’S MORALS</p>

<h3>1. Luther’s Vocation. His Standard of Life</h3>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">Reading</span> the lives of great men really sent by God who did
great things for the salvation of souls by their revelations
and their labours, whether narrated in the Bible or in the
history of the Christian Church, we find that, without
exception, their standards were high, that they sought to
convert those with whom they came in contact primarily by
their own virtuous example, that their aim was to promote
the spread of their principles and doctrines by honest,
truthful and upright means, and that their actions bore the
stamp, not of violence, but of peaceableness and charity
towards all brother Christians.</p>

<p>Luther’s friends have always protested against his being
compared with the Saints. Be their reason what it may,
when it is a question of the moral appreciation of the founder
of a religious movement everyone should be ready to admit,
that such a founder must not present too great a contrast
with those great harbingers of the faith in olden days whom
he himself claims as his ideal, and in whose footsteps he
pretends to tread. Luther is anxious to see St. Paul once
more restored to his pinnacle; his doctrine he would fain
re-establish. This being so, we may surely draw his attention
to the character of St. Paul as it appears to us in his
Epistles and in the Acts of the Apostles. St. Paul brought
into this dark world a new light, unknown heretofore,
which had been revealed to him together with his Divine
calling. His vocation he fostered by heroic virtues, and by
a purity of life free from all sensuality or frivolity, preaching
with all the attraction conferred by sincerity and honesty
of purpose, in words and deeds full of fire, indeed, yet at the
same time breathing the most patient and considerate
charity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Although we may not exact from Luther all the virtues of
a St. Paul, yet he cannot complain if his private life and his
practice and theory of morals be compared with the sublime
mission to which he laid claim. It is true, that, when confronted
with such a critical test, he was accustomed to meet
it with the assertion that his Evangel was unassailable
whatever his life might be. This, however, must not deter
us from applying the test in question, calmly and cautiously,
with every precaution against infringing the truth of
history and the claims of a just and unbiassed judgment
which are his right even at the hands of those whose views
are not his.</p>

<p>The following is merely an appreciation of some of the
sides of his character, not a general conspectus of his morals.
Such a conspectus will only become possible at the conclusion
of our work. This we mention because in what follows we
shall be considering almost exclusively Luther’s less favourable
traits and ethical principles. It is unavoidable that we
should consider here in this connection his own testimonies,
and those of other witnesses, which militate against his
Divine mission. His better points, both as man and writer,
will be impartially pointed out elsewhere.</p>

<p class="p2">Luther himself admitted that Christ’s words: “By their
fruits ye shall know them,” established a real standard
for the teachers of the Gospel. He was familiar with the
words of St. Bonaventure: “The sign of a call to the office
of preacher is the healing of the hearers from the maladies
of sin.”<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> He knew that the preacher’s virtue must be imparted
to others, and that the sublimity and purity of his
doctrine must be reflected in the amelioration of his
followers.</p>

<p>A mere glance at Wittenberg at the time of the religious
subversion will suffice to show how little such conditions
were realised. Valentine Ickelsamer was referring to well-known
facts when he confronted Luther with the words
of Christ quoted above. He added: “You boast of holding
the true doctrine on faith and charity and you shriek
that men merely condemn the imperfections of your life.”
He is here referring to Luther’s evasion. The latter had
complained that people under-valued him and were scandalised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
at his life and that of his friends. In 1538, for instance,
he was obliged, with the help of Jonas, Cruciger and
Melanchthon, to dissociate himself from a theologian, Master
George Karg, who had been advocating at Wittenberg
doctrines which differed from his own; of him he wrote:
“He is an inexperienced young man and, possibly, was
scandalised at us personally in the first instance, and then
fell away in his doctrine; for all those who have caused
dissensions among us have begun by despising us personally.”<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Amongst the Catholic writers who pointed out to the
Wittenberg professor that his lack of a Divine call or higher
mission was proved by the visible absence of any special
virtue, and by his behaviour as a teacher, we may mention
the Franciscan Johann Findling (Apobolymæus). In the
beginning of 1521 the latter published an “admonition”
addressed to Luther which relies chiefly on the reasons
mentioned above.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> In this anonymous writing the Franciscan
deals so considerately with the monk, who was already
then excommunicate, that recent Protestant writers have
actually contrasted him with the “Popish zealots.”<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> Luther
he terms his “beloved,” and is unwilling even to describe
him as a “heretic,”<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> following in this the example of many
other monks who showed the same scruple, probably on
account of their own former vacillation. Excuses of various
kinds are not wanting in Findling’s letter.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">What is of interest in the present connection is the question
the author sets before the originator of the schism in the following
challenge: “If you are a prophet or seer sent by God to
point out the truth to men, let us perceive this, that we may
believe in you, approve your action and follow you. If what you
preach and write is of Divine revelation, then we are ready to
honour you as a messenger sent from heaven.... But it is
written: ‘Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
be of God’ (1 John iv. 1).... We are unable to believe in
you because so much strife, so many intrigues, insults, bitter
reproaches, vituperation and abuse proceed from you....
Quarrels, blasphemies and enmities are, as St. Ambrose says, foreign
to the ministers of God.”<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> Your acrimony, your vituperation,
your calumny and abuse are such that one is forced to ask:
“Where is your Christian spirit, or your Lutheran spirit, for,
according to some, Lutheran means the same as Christian?”
Has not Christ commanded: “Love your enemies, pray for
those who persecute you? Certainly if prayer consists in calumny,
abuse, detraction, reviling and cursing, then you pray excellently
and effectually enough. Not one of all those I have ever read
curses and abuses others as you do.”<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p>The writer also points out how Luther’s followers imitate and
even outdo him; they were likewise turning his head by their
praises; they sang hymns in his honour, but hymns coming
from such lips were a poor tribute. Nor was the applause of the
masses beyond suspicion, for it merely showed that what he
wrote was to the taste of the multitude; for instance, when he
blamed the authorities and cited them before his tribunal. It
was his rude handling of his ghostly superiors which had brought
the nobility and the knights to his side. Had he overwhelmed
them and the laity with such reproaches as he had heaped upon
the spiritual authorities, then “I know not whether you would
still be in the land of the living.”<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>Apart from his want of charity and his censoriousness, other
very un-apostolic qualities of Luther’s were his pride and
arrogance, his utter disdain for obedience, his irascibility, his
jealousy and his want of seriousness in treating of the most
important questions that concerned humanity; the childish,
nay, womanish, outbursts in which notoriously he was wont to
indulge could only serve to humble him in his own eyes.</p>

<p>Luther must have felt keenly the Franciscan’s allusions to his
untruthfulness and evasiveness, more particularly in his conduct
towards the Pope, whereas Holy Scripture expressly declares
that “God has no need of a lie” (Job xiii. 7).</p>

<p>He concludes by saying, that if Luther “is a good and gentle
disciple of Christ,” then he will not disregard this exhortation
to turn back and recant.</p>

<p>Thus the Franciscan. It is to be feared, however, that Luther
never read the letter to its end. As he himself said, he had
nothing but scorn for anything that Catholic censors might say
to him. “Attacks from without only serve to render me proud
and arrogant, and you may see from my books how I despise my
gainsayers; I look upon them as simple fools.”<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> His state of
mind even then was such as to make him incapable of calmly
weighing such reproofs. In the following sentences the Franciscan
above referred to has aptly described Luther’s behaviour: Whoever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
allows himself to be overtaken by hatred and carried away
by fury, “blots out the light of reason within himself and darkens
his comprehension, so that he is no longer able to understand or
judge aright. He rushes blindly through the surrounding fog
and darkness, and knows not whither his steps will carry him.
Many people, dearest Martin, believe you to be in this state.”<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
“In this condition of mental confusion you cannot fail to go
astray; you will credit yourself with what is far beyond you and
quite outside your power.”<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> In such a man eloquence was like
a sword in the hand of a madman, as was sufficiently apparent in
the case of Luther’s followers who attempted to emulate his zeal
with the pen.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Erasmus was another moderate critic. In the matter of
Luther’s life, as was to be expected from one who had once
praised him in this particular, as a rule he is inclined to be
cautious, however unable to refrain from severely censuring
his unevangelical manner of proceeding. The absence of
the requisite standard of life seemed to Erasmus sufficient
to disprove Luther’s claim to the possession of the Spirit of
God and a higher mission. “You descend to calumny,
abuse and threats and yet you wish to be esteemed free
from guile, pure, and led by the Spirit of God, not by human
passion.”<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> “Can the Evangel then be preached in so unevangelical
a manner?” “Have all the laws of propriety
been abrogated by the new-born Evangel, so that each one
is at liberty to make use of any method of attack either in
word or writing? Is this the liberty which you restore to
us?”<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> He points more particularly to Luther’s demagogism
as alien to the Christian spirit: “Your object is to raise
revolt, and you are perfectly aware that this has often been
the result of your writings. Not thus did the Apostles act.
You drag our controversial questions before the tribunal of
the unlearned.”<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> “God Almighty! What a contrast to the
spirit of the Gospel!” exclaims Erasmus, referring to some
of Luther’s abuse. “A hundred books written against him
would not have alienated me from him so much as these
insults.”<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the admonitions addressed to Luther at an
early date by men of weight, that of Zaccaria Ferreri, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Papal Legate in Poland, written in 1520 and published in
1894, is particularly noteworthy. From the self-love and
arrogance which he found displayed in Luther’s character
he proves to him that his could not be the work of God:
“Do open your eyes and see into what an abyss of delusion
you are falling. You seem to fancy that you alone are in
the sunlight and that all the rest of the world is seated in the
darkness of night.... You reproach Christianity with
groping about in error for more than a thousand years;
in your madness you wish to appear wiser and better than
all other mortals put together, to all of whom you send
forth your challenge. Rest assured your opponents are not
so dull-witted as not to see through your artfulness and to
perceive the inconsistency and frivolity of your doctrines.”
Ferreri also addressed the following appeal to Luther:
“If you are determined to cast yourself into the abyss of
death, at least take pity on the unfortunate people whom
you are daily infecting with your poison, whose souls you are
destroying and dragging along with you to perdition. The
Almighty will one day require of you their blood which you
have drunk, and their happiness which you have destroyed.”<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Such voices from the past help to make us alive to the
importance of the question which forms the subject of the
present section. Luther’s own ethical practice when defending
the divinity of his mission, more particularly his doctrine
of the forgiveness of sins, against all doubts and “temptations”
which occurred to him, affords us, however, the best
and clearest insight into his moral standards. Here his
moral attitude appears in a most singular light.</p>

<p>We may preface what follows with some words of the
Protestant historian Gottlieb Jacob Planck (†1833):
“When it is necessary to lay bare Luther’s failings, an
historian should blush to fancy that any excuse is required
for so doing.”<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<p>“Temptations” to doubt were not uncommon in Luther’s
case and in that of his friends. He accordingly instructs his
disciples to combat them and to regain their lost equanimity
by the same method which he himself was in the habit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
employing. Foremost amongst these instructions is one
addressed to his pupil Hieronymus Weller of Molsdorf, a
native of Freiberg, who, whilst at Wittenberg, had, under
Luther’s influence, relinquished the study of the law for
that of theology. He was received into Luther’s household
as a boarder in 1527, and in 1535, after having secured his
Doctorate of Theology, he was still resident there. He was
one of the table-companions who took notes of Luther’s
“Table-Talk.” This young man was long and grievously
tormented with anxiety of mind and was unable to quiet, by
means of the new Evangel, the scruples of conscience which
were driving him to despair.</p>

<p>In 1530, Luther, writing from the Castle of Coburg, gave
him the following counsel; we must bear in mind that it
comes from one who was himself then struggling with the
most acute mental anxiety.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> “Sometimes it is necessary to
drink more freely, to play and to jest and even to commit
some sin (‘<i>peccatum aliquod faciendum</i>’) out of hatred
and contempt for the devil, so that he may get no chance of
making a matter of conscience out of mere trifles; otherwise
we shall be vanquished if we are too anxious about not
committing sin.... Oh that I could paint sin in a fair
light,<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> so as to mock at the devil and make him see that I
acknowledge no sin and am not conscious of having committed
any! I tell you, we must put all the Ten Commandments,
with which the devil tempts and plagues us so
greatly, out of sight and out of mind. If the devil upbraids
us with our sins and declares us to be deserving of
death and hell, then we must say: ‘I confess that I have
merited death and hell,’ but what then? Are you for that
reason to be damned eternally? By no means. ‘I know
One Who suffered and made satisfaction for me, viz. Jesus
Christ, the Son of God. Where He is, there I also shall be.’”</p>

<p>Fell counsels such as these, to despise sin and to meet the
temptation by sinning, Luther had certainly not learnt from
the spiritual writers of the past. Such writers, more particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
those whom he professed to have read at his
monastery, viz. Bernard, Bonaventure and Gerson, teach
that sin must first be resisted, after which we may then seek
prayerfully for the cause of the trouble; for this is not
always due to the temptations of the devil, as Luther
unquestioningly assumed in his own case and, consequently,
also in that of Weller. If conscience was oppressed by
sin, then, according to these spiritual writers, a remedy
different from that suited to doubts against the faith must
be applied, namely, penance, to be followed by acts of hope.
If the trouble in Weller’s case was one of doubts concerning
faith, anyone but Luther would have been careful to ascertain
first of all whether these doubts referred to the specifically
Lutheran doctrine or to the other truths of the Christian
revelation. Luther, however, at the commencement of the
letter, simply declares: “You must rest assured that this
temptation comes from the devil, and that you are thus
tortured because you believe in Christ”&mdash;i.e. in the
Lutheran doctrine and in the Christ preached by that sect,
as is clear from the reference immediately following to the
“foes of the Evangel,” who live in security and good cheer.</p>

<p>The whole letter, though addressed to one standing on the
brink of despair, contains not a single word about prayer
for God’s help, about humbling oneself or striving after a
change of heart. Beyond the above-mentioned reference
to Christ, Who covers over all our sins, and to the
need of contemning sin, we find merely the following natural,
indeed, of the earth earthly, remedies recommended,
viz.: To seek company, to indulge in jest and play, for
instance, with Luther’s wife, ever to keep a good temper and,
finally, “to drink more deeply.” “If the devil says, ‘Don’t
drink,’ answer him at once: ‘Just because you don’t wish
it, I shall drink, and deeply too.’ We must always do the
opposite of what the devil bids. Why, think you, do I drink
so much, converse so freely and give myself up so frequently
to the pleasures of the table, if it be not in order to mock
at the devil, and to plague him when he tries to torment and
mock at me?”</p>

<p>Finally he encourages the sorely tried man by telling him
how Staupitz had foretold that the temptations which he,
Luther, endured in the monastery would help to make a
great man of him, and that he had now, as a matter of fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
become a “great doctor.” “You, too,” he continues, “will
become a great man, and rest assured that such [prophetic]
words, particularly those that fall from the lips of great and
learned men, are not without their value as oracles and predictions.”</p>

<p>It is not surprising that such counsels and the consolation
of possible future greatness did not improve the pitiable
condition of the unfortunate man, but that he long continued
to suffer.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Of a like nature is the advice which Luther in the following
year gave another of his boarders and companions, Johann
Schlaginhaufen, as a remedy for the same malady, which indeed
seems to have been endemic in his immediate circle. The passages
in question, from Schlaginhaufen’s own notes, may be useful in
further elucidating Luther’s instructions to Weller.</p>

<p>According to what we are told Luther spoke as follows to
Schlaginhaufen on December 14, 1531, at a time when the latter
had been reduced to despair owing to his sins and to his lack of
the fiducial faith required by the new Evangel. “It is false that
God hates sinners; if the devil reminds us of the chastisement
of Sodom and other instances of God’s wrath, then let us confront
him with Christ, Who became man for us. Had God hated
sinners He would not have sent His own Son for us [here again
not the slightest allusion to any effort after an inward change of
heart, but merely what follows]: Those only does God hate who
will not be justified, i.e. those who will not be sinners (‘<i>qui non
volunt esse peccatores</i>’).”<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p>

<p>In these admonitions to Schlaginhaufen the consolatory
thought of the merits of Christ, which alone can save us, occurs
more frequently, though in a very Lutheran guise: “Why
torment yourself so much about sin? Even had you as many
sins on your conscience as Zwingli, Carlstadt, Münzer and all the
ungodly, faith in Christ would overcome them all. Alas, faith is
all that lacks us!” If the devil could reproach you with unbelief
and such-like faults, says Luther, then it would be a different
matter; but he does not worry us about the great sins of the first
table, but about other sins; “he annoys us with mere trifles; if
we would consent to worship the Pope, then we should be his
dear children.”<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> “We must cling to the Man Who is called
Christ, He will soon put right whatever we may have done
amiss.”<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p>“So that at last I said,” Schlaginhaufen continues, “Then,
Doctor, it would be better that I should remain a rogue and a
sinner. And the Doctor replied: That Thou, O Lord, mayst be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
justified in Thy words, and mayst overcome when Thou art
judged” (Ps. 1. 6).<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></p>

<p>With this pupil, as with Weller, Luther enters into an account
of his own temptations and the means he employed for ridding
himself of them.</p>

<p>He himself, he says, in December, 1531, had often been made a
target for the shafts of Satan. “About ten years ago I first
experienced this despair and these temptations concerning the
wrath of God. Afterwards I had some peace so that I enjoyed
good days and even took a wife, but then the temptations returned
again.”<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>“I never had any temptation greater or more burdensome
than that which assailed me on account of my preaching, when I
thought: It is you alone who are bringing all this business about;
if it is wrong, then you alone are accountable for so many souls
which go down to hell. During such temptations I often went
right down to hell, only that God called me back and strengthened
me, because it was His Word and true doctrine. But it costs
much before one can arrive at such comfort.”<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p>Here also he speaks of his remedy of a free indulgence in food
and drink: “Were I to give in to my want of appetite, then I
should [in this frame of mind] for three days eat not a scrap; it
is a double fast to me to eat and drink without the least inclination.
When the world sees this it looks upon it as drunkenness,
but God shall judge whether it is drunkenness or fasting ...
therefore keep stomach and head alike filled.”<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></p>

<p>According to another communication of Luther’s to this pupil,
he was in the habit of repelling the devil, when he troubled him
too much about his sins, by cynical speeches on the subject of the
evacuations. After one such statement the parish priest of
Wittenberg, the apostate Bugenhagen, interrupted him, and,
in perfect agreement with Luther, said, “I too would say to the
devil: ‘My good devil, I have committed a great sin, for Pope
and bishop anointed my hands and I have defiled them; that is
also a great sin.’”<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> From such coarse speeches Schlaginhaufen
passes on to relate other things which the veracious historian is
not at liberty to suppress. The anxious pupil who was seeking
consolation continues: “The Doctor [Luther] said: ‘Nevertheless,
the devil was unable to get over my arguments. Often
have I called my wife, et cetera, in order to allay the temptation
and to free myself from such idle thoughts.’”<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<p>What Luther, or rather Schlaginhaufen, merely hints at,
we find explained in greater detail in the diary of Luther’s pupil
Conrad Cordatus: “Thoughts of terror and sadness have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
worried me more than enemies and labours. In my attempts
to drive them away I met with little success. I also tried
caressing my wife in order that this distraction might free me
from the suggestions of Satan; but in temptations such as these
we can find no comfort, so greatly is our nature depraved. It is
necessary, however, to make every kind of effort to banish these
thoughts by some stronger emotion.”<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> One of the chief Latin
versions of Luther’s Colloquies gives this passage in his “Table-Talk”
as follows: “How often have I taken with my wife those
liberties which nature permits merely in order to get rid of
Satan’s temptations. Yet all to no purpose, for he refused to
depart; for Satan, as the author of death, has depraved our
nature to such an extent that we will not admit any consolation.
Hence I advise everyone who is able to drive away these Satanic
thoughts by diverting his mind, to do so, for instance, by thinking
of a pretty girl, of money-making, or of drink, or, in fine, by
means of some other vivid emotion. The chief means, however,
is to think of Jesus Christ, for He comes to console and to make
alive.”<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> The latter passage is to be found, with unimportant
alterations, in Rebenstock’s edition of the Colloquies, though,
perhaps out of consideration for Luther, it there commences
with the words: “For Satan”;<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> in the German “Table-Talk”
it is not found at all.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></p>

<p>“Let us fix our mind on other thoughts,” Luther had also said
to Schlaginhaufen, “on thoughts of dancing, or of a pretty girl,
that also is good. Gerson too wrote of this.”<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> As a matter of fact,
Gerson certainly wrote nothing about getting rid of temptations
by means of sensual images. On the contrary, in the passages
in question of his spiritual writings, he teaches something quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
different and insists, first and foremost, on the avoidance of sin. He
proposes our doing the exact opposite of the wicked or unworthy
acts suggested by the evil spirit. He, like all Catholic masters
of the spiritual life, indeed instructs those tempted to distract
their minds, but by pious, or at least, indifferent and harmless
means.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p></div>

<h3>2. Some of Luther’s Practical Principles of Life</h3>

<p>We find in Luther no dearth of strong expressions which,
like his advice to Weller and Schlaginhaufen, seem to
discountenance fear of sin, penance and any striving after
virtue. It remains to determine from their context the
precise meaning which he attached to them.</p>

<h4><i>Luther on Sin</i></h4>

<p>As early as 1518 Luther, in a sermon at Erfurt, had given
vent to the words already quoted: “What does it matter
whether we commit a fresh sin so long as we do not despair
but repeat: Thou, my God, still livest, Christ, my Lord,
has destroyed sin; then at once the sin is gone.... The
reason why the world is so out of joint and lies in such error
is that there has been no real preacher for so long.”<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p>“Hence we say,” so later on we read in his exposition of
John xvii., “that those who are true Saints of Christ must
be great sinners and yet remain Saints.... Of themselves,
and for all their works, they are nothing but sinners and
under condemnation, but by the holiness of another, viz.
of the Lord Christ, bestowed on them by faith, they are
made holy.”<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p>And further: “The Christian faith differs greatly from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the faith and religion of the Pope and the Turks, etc., for,
by it, in spite of his consciousness of sin, a man, amidst
afflictions and the fear of death, continues to hope that God
for Christ’s sake will not impute to him his sin.... But so
great is this grace that a man is startled at it and finds it
hard to believe.”<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>&mdash;He himself and many others often found
it difficult, indeed terribly difficult, to believe. They were
obliged to “reassure themselves” by the Word of God.
A few more quotations may here be added.</p>

<p>“To be clean of heart not only means not to harbour any
impure thoughts, but that the conscience has been enlightened
and assured by the Word of God that the law does
not defile; hence the Christian must understand
that it does not harm him whether he keeps it [the
law] or not; nay, he may even do what is otherwise forbidden,
or leave undone what is usually commanded; it is
no sin in him, for he is incapable of sinning because his heart
is clean. On the other hand, an impure heart defiles itself
and sins in everything because it is choked with law.”<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

<p>“God says in the law: Do this, leave that undone, this
do I require of thee. But the Evangel does not preach what
we are to do or to leave undone, it requires nothing of us.
On the contrary. It does not say: Do this or that,
but only tells us to hold out our hands and take: Behold, O
man, what God has done for thee; He has caused His
own Son to take flesh for thee, has allowed Him to be done
to death for thy sake, and to save thee from sin, death and
the devil; believe this and accept it and thou shalt be
saved.”<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p>Such statements, which must not be regarded as spoken
merely on the spur of the moment, rest on the idea that sin
only troubles the man who looks to the law; let us look
rather to the Gospel, which is nothing but grace, and simply
cover over our sin by a firm faith in Christ, then it will not
harm us in any way. Yet it would be quite a mistake to
infer from this that Luther always regarded sin with indifference,
or that he even recommended it on principle;
as a rule he did not go so far as we just saw him do (p. 175 ff.)
in his exhortations to persons tempted; there, moreover, his
invitation to commit sin, and his other misplaced instructions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
may possibly be explained by the excitement of the hand-to-hand
struggle with the devil, in which he fancied himself
to be engaged whenever he had to do with doubts concerning
his doctrines, or with souls showing signs of halting or
of despair. On the contrary, he teaches, as a rule, that sin
is reprehensible; he also instructs man to fight against
concupiscence which leads up to it. (Vol. i., p. 114 f.)
He is fond of exhorting to amendment of life and to avoid
any scandal. Still, the barriers admitted by his doctrine of
Justification against this indifference with regard to sin
were not strong enough.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p>As to Luther’s teaching on the manner in which sin was
forgiven, we shall merely state his ideas on this subject,
without attempting to bring them into harmony; the fact
is that, in Luther’s case, we must resign ourselves to a
certain want of sequence.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">He teaches: “Real faith is incompatible with any sin whatsoever;
whoever is a believer must resist sinful lusts by the
power and the impulse of the faith and Spirit.”<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> “Whoever has
faith in the forgiveness of sins does not obey sinful lusts, but
fights against them until he is rid of them.”<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> Where mortal sin
has been committed, there, according to him, real faith was
manifestly lacking; it had already been denied and was no
longer active, or even present. A revival of faith, together with
the necessary qualities of confidence, covers over all such sins,
including the sin of unbelief. On the other hand, sins committed
where faith was present, though for the moment too weak to offer
resistance, were sins of frailty; there faith at once regains the
upper hand and thus forgiveness or non-imputation of the sin is
secured. The denial of Peter was, according to Luther, a sin of
frailty, because it was merely due to “chance weakness and
foolishness.” Nevertheless he declares that, like the treason of
Judas, it was deserving of death.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<p>Luther teaches further, affording us incidentally an insight
into the inadequacy of his doctrine from another point of view,
that, in the case of the heathen or of Christians who had no faith,
not only was every sin a mortal sin, but also all works, even
good works, were mortal sins; indeed, they would be so even in
the faithful, were it not for Christ, the Redeemer, Whom we
must cling to with confidence. Moreover, as we know, man’s
evil inclinations, the motions of concupiscence, the bad tendencies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
of the pious, were all grievous sins in Luther’s eyes; original sin
with its involuntary effects he considers an enduring offence;
only faith, which merits forgiveness and overcomes the terrors
of conscience by the saving knowledge of Christ, can ensure man
against it, and the other sins.</p>

<p>“Thus our salvation or rejection depends entirely on whether
we believe or do not believe in Christ.... Unbelief retains all
sin, so that it cannot be forgiven, just as faith cancels all sin;
hence outside of such faith everything is and remains sinful and
worthy of damnation, even the best of lives, and the best of
works.... In faith a Christian’s life and works are pleasing to
God, outside of Christ everything is lost and doomed to perdition;
in Christ all is good and blessed, so that even the sin which flesh
and blood inherits from Adam is neither a cause of harm nor of
condemnation.” “This, however, is not to be understood as a
permit to sin and to commit evil; for since faith brings forgiveness
of sin ... it is impossible that he who lives openly unrepentant
and secure in his sins and lusts should be a Christian
and a believer.”<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> In conclusion he explains to what category of
hearers he is speaking: “To them [the faithful] this is said, in
order that sin may not harm nor condemn them; to the others,
who are without faith and reprobate, we do not preach.”<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>
Amongst the numerous other questions which here force themselves
upon us, one is, why Luther did not address his Evangel
to those “without faith,” and to the “reprobate,” according to
the example of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>The fanatics, particularly Carlstadt, were not slow in attacking
Luther on account of his doctrine of faith alone. Carlstadt
described this “faith” of Luther’s as a “paper faith” and a
“heartless faith.” He perceived the “dangers to the interior
life which might arise from the stress laid on faith alone, viz. the
enfeebling of the moral powers and the growth of formalism.”<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>
The modern Protestant biographer of Carlstadt, from whom
these words are taken, points out that “moral laxity too often
went hand-in-hand with Luther’s doctrine of the forgiveness of
sins.”<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> “Owing to an assiduous depreciation of the moral code no
criterion existed according to which the direction of the impulses
of the will could be determined, according to Luther’s doctrine of
Justification.”<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> The Lutheran teaching was “admirably adapted
to suit the life of the individual,” but the moral laxity which
followed in its train “could not be considered as merely an
exceptional phenomenon.”<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> There is no doubt that “much
dross came to the surface when ‘faith only’ was applied to the
forgiveness of sins.”<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p>A Protestant theologian, A. Hegler, one of those who demur
to Luther’s doctrines, mentioned above, owing to their moral consequences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
remarks: “It remains that the idea of justification
without works was, at the time of the Reformation, often found
side by side with moral laxity, and that, sometimes, the latter was
actually the effect of the former.” Seeking the reason why so
talented a man as Sebastian Franck should have seceded, after
having been a Lutheran preacher till 1528, he remarks: “There
is much to lead us to suppose that the sight of the moral indifference
and coarseness of the evangelicals was the determining
factor.”<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">After having considered Luther’s principles with regard
to the theory of sin, we now proceed to give some of his
utterances on penance.</p>

<h4><i>Luther’s Views on Penance</i></h4>

<p>Although he speaks of repentance as the first step towards
salvation in the case of the sinner, yet the idea of repentance,
remorse or contrition was ever rather foreign to him. He
will not admit as valid any repentance aroused by the
demands and menaces of the law;<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> in the case of man,
devoid of free will, it must be a result of Divine charity and
grace; repentance without a love of justice is, he says,
at secret enmity with God and only makes the sin greater.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>
Yet he also declares, not indeed as advocating penance as
such, that it merely acts through faith “previous to and
independently of all works,” of which, as we know, he was
always suspicious; all that was needed was to believe “in
God’s Mercy,” and repentance was already there.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

<p>He is nevertheless in favour of the preachers exhorting
Christians to repentance by diligent reference to the commandments,
and to the chastisements threatened by God,
so as to instil into them a salutary fear. The law, he goes on
to say, in contradiction to the above, must do its work, and
by means of its terrors drive men to repentance even though
love should have no part in it. Here he is perfectly conscious
of the objection which might be raised, viz. that he had made
“repentance to proceed from, and to be the result of, justifying
faith.” To this he replies, that repentance itself forms
part of the “common faith,” because it is first necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
believe that there is a God Who commands and makes
afraid; this circumstance justifies the retention of penance,
“for the sake of the common, unlearned folk.”<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">The Catholic Church, on the other hand, formulates her doctrine
of penance and regeneration, for the most cultured as well as
for the “common and unlearned,” in terms simple and comprehensible,
and in perfect accord with both Scripture and
theology: Adults “are prepared for justification, when, moved
and assisted by Divine grace ... they, of their free will, turn
to God, believing that those things are true which have been
Divinely revealed and promised; above all, that the ungodly is
justified by God’s grace and by the redemption which is in
Christ Jesus; recognising with a wholesome fear of the Divine
Justice their sinfulness, they turn to God’s mercy, and, being thus
established in hope, gain the confidence that God, for Christ’s
sake, will be gracious to them. Thus they begin to love God as
the source of all justice and to conceive a certain hatred (‘<i>odium
aliquod</i>’) and detestation for sin, i.e. to perform that penance
which must take place previous to baptism. Finally, they must
have the intention of receiving baptism, of commencing a new
life and of observing the commandments of God.”<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> “Those
who, after having received the grace of justification, fall into sin
[’without loss of faith’],<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> with God’s help may again be justified,
regaining through the Sacrament of Penance and Christ’s merits
the grace they had lost.... Christ Jesus instituted the Sacrament
of Penance when He said: ‘Receive ye the Holy Ghost:
whose sins ye shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose
sins ye shall retain, they are retained.’ Hence we must teach
that the repentance of a sinner after falling into sin is very
different from that which accompanies baptism, and involves
not merely a turning away from, and a detestation for, sin, or
a contrite and humble heart, but also a Sacramental confession
of the sin, or at least a purpose of making such a confession in
due season, and receiving the priestly absolution; finally, it
involves satisfaction by fasting, almsdeeds, prayer and other
pious exercises.”<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Such, according to the Catholic doctrine, is the process
approved of by Holy Scripture, the various phases of which
rest alike on religion and psychology, on the positive
ordinances of God and on human nature. Luther, however,
thrust all this aside; his quest was for a simpler and easier
method, through faith alone, by which sin may be vanquished
or covered over.</p>

<p>His moral character, so far as it reveals itself in his teaching,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
is here displayed in an unfavourable light, for he is never
weary of emphasising the ease with which sin can be covered
over&mdash;and that in language which must necessarily have
had a bad effect on discipline&mdash;when we might have expected
to hear some earnest words on penance. A few of his sayings
will help to make yet clearer his earlier statements.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“You see how rich the Christian is,” he says, “since, even
should he desire it, he is unable to forfeit his salvation, no matter
how many sins he may commit, unless indeed he refuses to believe
(‘<i>nisi nolit credere</i>’). No sin but unbelief can bring him to
damnation; everything else is at once swept away by this faith,
so soon as he returns to it, or recollects the Divine promise made
to the baptised.”<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>

<p>“Christ’s Evangel is indeed a mighty thing.... God’s Word
brings everything to pass speedily, bestows forgiveness of sins
and the gift of eternal life; and the cost of this is merely that
you should hear the Word, and after hearing it believe. If you
believe, then you possess it without any trouble, expense, delay
or difficulty.”<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

<p>“No other sin exists in the world save unbelief. All others
are mere trifles, as when my little Hans or Lena misbehave themselves
in the corner, for we all take that as a big joke. In the
same way faith covers the stench of our filth before God....
All sins shall be forgiven us if only we believe in the Son.”<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p>

<p>“As I have often said, the Kingdom of Christ is nothing else
but forgiveness and perpetual blotting out of sin, which is extinguished,
covered over, swept away and made clean while we are
living here.” “Christ makes things so easy for us who stand
before God in fear and trembling.”<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<p>“<i>Summa summarum</i>: Our life is one long ‘<i>remissio peccatorum</i>,’
and forgiveness of sin, otherwise it could not endure.”<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p>Here, indeed, we have one of the main props of Luther’s
practical theology. To this the originator of the doctrine sought
to remain faithful to the very end of his life, whereas certain
other points of his teaching he was not unwilling to revise. His
ideas on sin and repentance had sprung originally from his desire
to relieve his own conscience,<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> and, of this, they ever retained
the mark. The words and doctrine of a teacher are the best
witnesses we have to his moral character, and here the doctrine
is one which affords but little stimulus to virtue and Christian
perfection, but rather the reverse.</p></div>

<p class="p1">In what follows we shall consider more closely the relation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
between this doctrine and the effort after virtue, while at
the same time taking into account that passivity, nay,
entire unfreedom of the will for doing what is good, proclaimed
by Luther.</p>

<h4><i>Luther on Efforts after Higher Virtue.</i></h4>

<p>The effort to attain perfection and to become like to
Christ, which is the highest aim of the Christian, is scarcely
promoted by making the whole Gospel to consist merely
in the happy enjoyment of forgiveness. The hard work
required for the building up of a truly virtuous life on the
rude soil of the world, necessarily involving sacrifice, self-denial,
humiliation and cheerful endurance of suffering, was
more likely to be looked at askance and carefully avoided
by those who clung to such a view.</p>

<p>On the pretext of opposing the “false humility of the
holy-by-works,” Luther attacks many practices which have
always been dear to pious souls striving after God. At the
same time he unjustly implies that the Catholics made
holiness to consist merely in extraordinary works, performed,
moreover, by human strength alone, without the
assistance of grace. “This all comes from the same old
craze,” he declares;<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> “as soon as we hear of holiness we
immediately think of great and excellent works and stand
gaping at the Saints in heaven as though they had got there
by their own merits. What <i>we</i> say is that the Saints must
be good, downright sinners.” (See above, p. 180.) “The
most holy state is that of those who believe that Christ
alone is our holiness, and that by virtue of His holiness, as
already stated, everything about us, our life and actions, are
holy, just as the person too is holy.”<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></p>

<p>After this, who can contend that Luther sets before the
world the sublime and arduous ideal of a life of virtue such
as has ever been cherished by souls inflamed with the love
of Christ? To rest content with a standard so low is indeed
to clip the wings of virtue. This is in no way compensated
for by Luther’s fervent exhortations to the Christian, “to
confess the Word, more particularly in temptation and
persecution,” because true and exalted virtue was present
wherever there was conflict on behalf of the Word [as
preached by him], or by his asseveration, that “where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Word is and brings forth fruit so that men are willing to
suffer what must be suffered for it, there indeed we have
living Saints.” Living Saints? Surely canonisation is
here granted all too easily. Nor does Luther make good the
deficiencies of his teaching, by depriving good works of any
merit for heaven, or by requiring that they should be performed
purely out of love of God, without the least thought
of reward. He thereby robs the practice of good works of
a powerful stimulus, as much in conformity with the Will
of God as with human nature. He is too ready here to
assume that the faithful are angels, raised above all incentive
arising from the hope of reward, though, elsewhere, he looks
upon men only too much as of the earth earthly.</p>

<p>At any rate he teaches that good works spring spontaneously
from the faith by which man is justified, and that
the outcome is a life of grace in which the faithful has every
incentive to the performance of his duty and to works of
charity towards his neighbour. He also knows how to
depict such spontaneous, practical efforts on the part of the
righteous in attractive colours and with great feeling.
Passages of striking beauty have already been quoted above
from his writings. Too often, as he himself complains, such
good works are conspicuous by their absence among the
followers of the evangelical faith; he is disappointed to see
that the new teaching on faith serves only to engender lazy
hearts. Yet this was but natural; nature cannot be overcome
even in the man who is justified without an effort on
his part; without exertion, self-sacrifice, self-conquest and
prayer no one can make any progress and become better
pleasing to God; not holiness-by-works, but the sanctifying
of our works, is the point to be aimed at, and, for this purpose,
Holy Scripture recommends no mere presumptuous, fiducial
faith as the starting-point, but rather a pious fear of God,
combined with a holy life; no mere reliance on a misapprehension
of the freedom of the children of God, but
rather severe self-discipline, watchfulness and mortification
of the whole man, who, freely and of his own accord, must
make himself the image of his crucified Saviour. Those of
Luther’s followers who, to their honour, succeeded in so
doing, did so, and were cheered and comforted, not by
following their leader’s teaching, but by the grace of God
which assists every man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>We must, however, refer to another point of importance
already once discussed. Why speak at all of good works
and virtue, when Luther’s doctrine of the passivity and
unfreedom of the will denies the existence of all liberty as
regards either virtue or sin? (See vol. ii., p. 223 ff.)</p>

<p>Luther’s doctrine of Justifying Faith is closely bound
up with his theories on the absence of free will, man’s
inability to what do is good, and the total depravity of
human nature resulting from original sin. In his “<i>De servo
arbitrio</i>” against Erasmus, Luther deliberately makes the
absence of free will the basis of his view of life.</p>

<p>Deprived of any power of choice or self-determination,
man is at the mercy of external agents, diabolical or Divine,
to such an extent that he is unable to will except what they
will. Whoever has and keeps the Spirit of God and the
faith cannot do otherwise than fulfil the Will of God; but
whoever is under the domination of the devil is his spiritual
captive. To sum up what was said previously: man
retains at most the right to dispose of things inferior to him,
not, however, any actual, moral freedom of choice, still less
any liberty for doing what is good such as would exclude all
interior compulsion. He is created for eternal death or for
everlasting life; his destiny he cannot escape; his lot is
already pre-ordained. Luther’s doctrine brings him into
line, even as regards the “harshest consequences of the
predestinarian dogma, with Zwingli, Calvin, and Melanchthon
in his earliest evangelical Theology.”<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> According to one of
the most esteemed of Lutheran theologians, “what finds
full and comprehensive expression in the work ‘<i>De servo
arbitrio</i>’ is simply the conviction which had inspired
Luther throughout his struggle for his pet doctrine of salvation,
viz. the doctrine of the pure grace of God as against
the prevailing doctrine of free will and man’s own works.”<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>
According to this theory, in spite of the lack of free will,
God requires of man that he should keep the moral law,
and, to encourage him, sets up a system of rewards and
punishments. Man is constrained to this as it were in
mockery, that, as Luther says, God may make him to realise
his utter powerlessness.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> God indeed deplores the spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
ruin of His people&mdash;this much the author is willing to allow
to his opponent Erasmus&mdash;but, the God Who does so is the
God of revelation, not the Hidden God. “The God Who
conceals Himself beneath His Majesty grieves not at man’s
undoing, He takes no step to remedy it, but works all things,
both life and death.” God, “by that unsearchable knowledge
of His, wills the death of the sinner.”<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p>“Even though Judas acted of his own will and without
compulsion, still his willing was the work of God, Who moved
him by His Omnipotence as He moves all things.”<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> In the
same way, according to Luther, the hardening of Pharao’s
heart was in the fullest sense God’s work.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> Adam’s sin
likewise is to be traced back to the Will of God.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> We must
not ask, however, how all this can be reconciled with the
goodness and justice of God. We must not expect God to act
according to human law.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<p>It was necessary to recall the above in order to show how
such a doctrine robs the moral law of every inward relation
to its last end, and degrades it till it becomes a mere outward,
arbitrary barrier. Luther may well thank his want of logic
that this system failed to be carried to its extremest consequences;
the ways of the world are not those of the
logician.</p>

<p>Who but God can be held responsible in the last instance
for the world being, as Luther complains, the “dwelling-place”
of the devil, and his very kingdom? According to
him the devil is its “Prince and God”;<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> every place is
packed with devils.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> Indeed, “the whole world is Satanic
and to a certain extent identified with Satan.”<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> “In such a
kingdom all the children of Adam are subject to their lord
and king, i.e. the devil.”<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> Such descriptions given by
Luther are often so vivid that one might fancy the devil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
was making war upon God almost like some independent
power. Luther, however, admits that the devil has “only
a semblance of the Godhead, and that God has reserved
to Himself the true Godhead.”<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> Ethically the consequence
of such a view of the world is a pessimism calculated to
lame both the powers and the desires of anyone striving
after higher aims.</p>

<p>Luther’s pessimism goes so far, that too often he is ready to
believe that, unlike the devil, Christ loves “to show Himself
weak” in man. He writes, for instance, that Satan
desired to drag him in his toils down into the abyss, but that
the “weak Christ” was ever victorious, or at least “fighting
bravely.”<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> That it was possible for Christ to be overcome
he would not have allowed, yet, surely, an excuse
might have been sought for man’s failings in Christ’s own
“weakness,” particularly if man is really devoid of free will
for doing what is good.</p>

<p>Luther was always fond of imputing weaknesses and sins
to the Saints. Their works he regarded as detracting from
the Redemption and the Grace of Christ, which can be
appropriated only by faith. Certain virtues manifested by
the Saints and their heroic sacrifices Luther denounced as
illusions, as morally impossible and as mere idolatry.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The Apostles themselves were sinners, yea, regular scoundrels....
I believe that the prophets also frequently sinned grievously,
for they were men like us.”<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> He quotes examples from the
history of the Apostles previous to the descent of the Holy Ghost.
Elsewhere he alludes to the failings they betrayed even in later life.
“To hear” that the Apostles, even after they had received the
Holy Ghost, were “sometimes weak in the faith,” is, he says,
“very consoling to me and to all Christians.” Peter “not only
erred” in his treatment of the Gentile Christians (Gal. ii. 11 ff.),
“but sinned grossly and grievously.” The separation of Paul
and Barnabas (Acts xv. 39) was very blameworthy. “Such
instances,” he says, “are placed before us for our comfort; for
it is very consoling to hear that such great Saints have also
sinned.” “Samson, David and many other fine and mighty
characters, filled as they were with the Holy Ghost, fell into
great sins,” which is a “splendid consolation to faint-hearted
and troubled consciences.” Paul himself did not believe as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
firmly as he spoke; he was, in point of fact, better able to speak
and write than to believe. “It would scarcely be right for us to
do all that God has commanded, for then what need would there
be for the forgiveness of sins?”<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></p>

<p>“Unless God had told us how foolishly the Saints themselves
acted, we should not have been able to arrive at the knowledge
of His Kingdom, which is nothing else but the forgiveness of
sins.”<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> Here He is referring to the stumbling and falls of the
Patriarchs; he adds: “What wonder that we stumble? And
yet this is no cloak or excuse for committing sin.” Nevertheless,
he speaks of Abraham, whom he credits with having fallen into
idolatry and sin, as though holiness of life were of no great
importance: “Believe as he did and you are just as holy as he.”<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>
“We must interpret all these stories and examples as told of
men like ourselves; it is a delusion to make such a fuss about
the Saints. We ought to say: If they were holy, why, so are we;
if we are sinners, why, so were they; for we are all born of the
same flesh and blood and God created us as much as He did them;
one man is as good as another, and the only difference between
us is faith. If you have faith and the Word of God, you are just
as great; you need not trouble yourself about being of less
importance than he, unless your faith is less strong.”<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">By his “<i>articulus remissionis</i>,” the constantly reiterated
Evangel of the forgiveness of sins by faith, Luther certainly
succeeded in putting down the mighty from their seats, but
whether he inspired the lowly to qualify for their possession
is quite another question.</p>

<p>On the unsafe ground of the assurance of salvation by
faith alone even the fanatics were unwilling to stand; their
preference was for a certain interior satisfaction to be secured
by means of works. Hence they and their teaching&mdash;to tell
the truth a very unsatisfactory one&mdash;became a target for
Luther’s sarcasm. By a pretence of strict morals they
would fain give the lie to the words of the Our Father,
“Forgive us our trespasses”; “but we are determined not
to make the Our Father untrue, nor to reject this article
(the ‘<i>remissio peccatorum</i>’), but to retain it as our most
precious treasure, in which lies our safety and salvation.”<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>
An over-zealous pursuit of sanctity and the works of the
Spirit might end by detracting from a trusting reliance upon
Christ. In Catholic times, for instance, the two things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
works and faith, had, so he complains, been “hopelessly
mixed.” “This, from the beginning until this very day,
has been a stumbling-block and hindrance to the new
doctrine of faith. If we preach works, then an end is made
of faith; hence, if we teach faith, works must go to the
wall.”<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></p>

<p>We must repeat, that, by this, Luther did not mean to
exclude works; on the contrary, he frequently counsels
their performance. He left behind him many instructions
concerning the practice of a devout life, of which we shall
have to speak more fully later. On the other hand, however,
we can understand how, on one occasion, he refused
to draw up a Christian Rule of Life, though requested to do
so by his friend Bugenhagen, arguing that such a thing was
superfluous. We can well understand his difficulty, for
how could he compile a rule for the promotion of practical
virtue when he was at the same time indefatigable in condemning
the monkish practices of prayer and meditation,
pious observances and penitential exercises, as mere
formalities and outgrowths of the theory of holiness-by-works?
It was quite in keeping with his leading idea, and
his hatred of works, that he should stigmatise the whole
outward structure of the Christian life known hitherto as
a mere “service of imposture.”</p>

<p>“Christ has become to all of us a cloak for our shame.”<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a></p>

<p>“Our life and all our doings must not have the honour
and glory of making us children of God and obtaining for us
forgiveness of sins and everlasting life. What is necessary
is that you should hear Christ saying to you: ‘Good
morning, dear brother, in Me behold your sin and death
vanquished.’ The law has already been fulfilled, viz. by
Christ, so that it is not necessary to fulfil it, but only to hang
it by faith around Him who fulfils it, and to become like
Him.”<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a></p>

<p>“This is the Evangel that brings help and salvation to
the conscience in despair.... The law with its demands
had disheartened, nay, almost slain it, but now comes this
sweet and joyful message.”<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“Be a sinner and sin boldly, but believe more boldly
still.”<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></p>

<h4><i>Luther’s “Pecca fortiter.”</i></h4>

<p>In what has gone before, that we might the better see how
Luther’s standard of life compared with his claim to a higher
calling, we have reviewed in succession his advice and conduct
with regard to one of the principal moral questions of the
Christian life, viz. how one is to behave when tempted to
despondency and to despair of one’s salvation; further, his
attitude&mdash;theoretical and practical&mdash;towards sin, penance
and the higher tasks and exercises of Christian virtue. On
each several point the ethical defects of his system came
to light, in spite of all his efforts to conceal them by appealing
to the true freedom of the Christian, to the difference between
the law and the Gospel, or to the power of faith in the merits
of Christ.</p>

<p>On glancing back at what has been said, we can readily
understand why those Catholic contemporaries, who took
up the pen against Luther and his followers, directed their
attacks by preference on these points of practical morality.</p>

<p>Johann Fabri (i.e. Schmidt) of Heilbronn, who filled the
office of preacher at Augsburg Cathedral until he was forced
to vacate the pulpit owing to the prohibition issued by the
Magistrates against Catholic preaching in 1534, wrote at a
later date, in 1553, in his work “The Right Way,” of Luther
and those preachers who shared his point of view: “The
sweet, sugary preachers who encourage the people in their
wickedness say: The Lord has suffered for us, good works
are unclean and sinful, a good, pious and honest life with
fasting, etc., is mere Popery and hypocrisy, the Lord has
merited heaven for us and our goodness is all worthless.
These and such-like are the sweet, sugary words they preach,
crying: Peace, Peace! Heaven has been thrown open,
only believe and you are already justified and heirs of
heaven. Thus wickedness gets the upper hand, and those
things which draw down upon us the wrath of God and rob
us of eternal life are regarded as no sin at all. But the end
shall prove whether the doctrine is of God, as the fruit
shows whether the tree is good. What terror and distress
has been caused in Germany by those who boast of the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Gospel it is easier to bewail than to describe. Ungodliness,
horrible sins and vices hold the field; greater and more
terrible evil, fear and distress have never before been heard
of, let alone seen in Germany.”<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

<p>Matthias Sittardus, from the little town of Sittard in the
Duchy of Jülich, a zealous and energetic worker at Aachen,
wrote as follows of Luther’s exhortations quoted above:
“The result is that men say, What does sin matter? Christ
took it away on the cross; the evil that I do&mdash;for I must
sin and cannot avoid it&mdash;He is ready to bear; He will
answer for it and refrain from imputing it to me; I have
only to believe and off it goes like a flash. Good works have
actually become a reproach and are exposed to contempt
and abuse.”<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>&mdash;Elsewhere he laments, that “there is much
glorying in and boasting of faith,” but of “good works and
actions little” is seen.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></p>

<p>Alluding to man’s unfreedom for doing what is good, as
advocated by Luther, Johann Mensing, a scholarly and busy
popular writer, says: “They [the preachers] call God a
sinner and maintain that God does all our sins in us. And
when they have sinned most grievously they argue that
such was God’s Will, and that they could do nothing but by
God’s Will. They look upon the treachery of Judas, the
adultery of David and Peter’s denial as being simply the
work of God, just as much as the best of good deeds.”<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p>The words quoted above: “Be a sinner and sin boldly,
but believe more boldly still,” are Luther’s own.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">The saying, which must not be taken apart from the context,
was employed by Luther in a letter to Melanchthon, on August 1,
1521.<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> The writer, who was then at the Wartburg, was engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
in a “heated struggle”<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> on the question of the Church, and on
religious vows, for the setting aside of which he was seeking a
ground. At the Wartburg he was, on his own confession, a prey
to “temptations and sins,”<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> though in this he only saw the proof
that his Evangel would triumph over the devil. The letter is
the product of a state of mind, restless, gloomy and exalted, and
culminates in a prophetic utterance concerning God’s approaching
visitation of Germany on account of its persecution of the
Evangel.</p>

<p>The passage which at present interests us, taken together with
the context, runs thus:</p>

<p>“If you are a preacher of grace, then preach a real, not a
fictitious grace; if your grace is real, then let your sin also be real
and not fictitious. God does not save those who merely fancy
themselves sinners. Be a sinner and sin boldly, but believe more
boldly still (‘<i>esto peccator et pecca fortiter, sed fortius fide</i>’); and
rejoice in Christ, Who is the conqueror of sin, death and the
world; we must sin as long as we are what we are. This life is
not the abode of justice, but we look for a new heaven and a new
earth wherein dwelleth righteousness, as Peter says. It suffices
that by the riches of the glory of God we have come to know the
Lamb, Who taketh away the sin of the world; sin shall not drag
us away from Him, even should we commit fornication or murder
thousands and thousands of times a day. Do you think that the
price and the ransom paid for our sins by this sublime Lamb is
so insignificant? Pray boldly, for you are in truth a very bold
sinner.”</p>

<p>This is language of the most extravagant paradox. What it
really means is very objectionable. Melanchthon is to pray very
fervently with the hope of obtaining the Divine assistance
against sin, but at the same time he is to sin boldly. This
language of the Wartburg is not unlike that in which Luther
wrote, from the Castle of Coburg, to his pupil, Hieronymus
Weller, when the latter was tempted to despair, to encourage him
against the fear of sin (above, p. 175 f.); that letter too was written
in anguish of spirit and in a state of excitement similar to what
he had experienced in the Wartburg. We might, it is true, admit
that, in these words Luther gave the rein to his well-known
inclination to put things in the strongest light, a tendency to be
noticed in some of his other statements quoted above. On the
other hand, however, the close connection between the compromising
words and his whole system of sin and grace, can scarcely
be denied; we have here something more than a figure of rhetoric.
Luther’s endeavour was to reassure, once and for all, Melanchthon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
who was so prone to anxiety. The latter shrank from many of
the consequences of Luther’s doctrines, and at that time was
possibly also a prey to apprehension concerning the forgiveness
of his own sins. Hence the writer of the letter seeks to convince
him that the strength of the fiducial faith preached by himself,
Luther, was so great, that no sense of sin need trouble a man.
To have “real, not fictitious, sin” to him, means as much as:
Be bold enough to look upon yourself as a great sinner; “Be
a sinner,” means: Do not be afraid of appearing to be a sinner
in your own sight; Melanchthon is to be a bold sinner in his
own eyes in order that he may be the more ready to ascribe all
that is good to the grace which works all. Thus far there is
nothing which goes beyond Luther’s teaching elsewhere.</p>

<p>The passage is, however, more than a mere paradoxical way
of expressing the doctrine dear to him.</p>

<p>Luther, here and throughout the letter, does not say what he
ought necessarily to have said to one weighed down by the
consciousness of sin; of remorse and compunction we hear
nothing whatever, nor does he give due weight and importance
to the consciousness of guilt; he misrepresents grace, making it
appear as a mere outward, magical charm, by which&mdash;according
to an expression which cannot but offend every religious mind&mdash;a
man is justified even though he be a murderer and a libertine a
thousand times over. Luther’s own words here are perhaps the
best refutation of the Lutheran doctrine of Justification, for he
speaks of sin, even of the worst, in a way that well lays bare the
weaknesses of the system of fiducial faith.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that Luther should have impressed such a
stigma upon his principal doctrine, both in his earliest statements
of it, for instance, in his letter to George Spenlein in 1516, and,
again, in one of his last epistles to a friend, also tormented by
scruples of conscience, viz. George Spalatin.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">In the above-mentioned letter to Melanchthon, in which
Luther expresses his contempt for sin by the words “<i>Pecca
fortiter</i>,” he is not only encouraging his friend with regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to possible sins of the past, but is also thinking of temptations
in the future. His advice is: Sin boldly and fearlessly&mdash;whereas
what one would have expected would have
been: Should you fall, don’t despair. The underlying idea
is: No sin is so detestable as to affright the believer, which
is further explained by the wanton phrase: “even should
we commit fornication or murder thousands and thousands
of times a day.”</p>

<p>However much stress we may be disposed to lay on
Luther’s warnings against sin, and whatever allowance we
may make for his rhetoric, still the “<i>Pecca fortiter</i>” stands out
as the result of his revolt against the traditional view of sin
and grace, with which his own doctrine of Justification refused
to be reconciled. These inauspicious words are the culmination
of Luther’s practical ideas on religion, borne witness to by
so many of his statements, which, at the cost of morality,
give the reins to human freedom and to disorder. Such was
the state of mind induced in him by the spirits of the
Wartburg, such the enthusiasm which followed his “spiritual
baptism” on his “Patmos,” that isle of sublime revelations.</p>

<p>Such is the defiance involved in the famous saying that an
impartial critic, Johann Adam Möhler, in his “Symbolism”
says: “Although too much stress must not be laid on the
passage, seeing how overwrought and excited the author
was, yet it is characteristic enough and important from the
point of view of the history of dogma.”<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> G. Barge, in
his Life of Carlstadt, says, that Luther in his letter to
Melanchthon had reduced “his doctrine of Justification by
faith alone to the baldest possible formula.”<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> “If Catholic
research continues to make this [the ‘<i>Pecca fortiter</i>’] its
point of attack, we must honestly admit that there is reason
in its choice.”</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">The last words are from Walter Köhler, now at the University
of Zürich, a Protestant theologian and historian, who has severely
criticised all Luther’s opinions on sin and grace.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<p>One of the weak points of Luther’s theology lies, according
to Köhler,<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> in the “clumsiness of his doctrine of sin and salvation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>”
“How, in view of the total corruption of man” (through
original sin, absence of free will and loss of all power), can redemption
be possible at all unless by some mechanical and supernatural
means? Luther says: “By faith alone.” But his
“faith is something miraculous, in which psychology has no
part whatever; the corruption is mechanical and so is the act
of grace which removes it.” In Luther’s doctrine of sin, as
Köhler remarks, the will, the instrument by which the process
of redemption should be effected, becomes a steed “ridden
either by God or by the devil. If the Almighty is the horseman,
He throws Satan out of the saddle, and <i>vice versa</i>; the steed,
however, remains entirely helpless and unable to rid himself of
his rider. In such a system Christ, the Redeemer, must appear
as a sort of ‘<i>deus ex machina</i>,’ who at one blow sets everything
right.” It would not be so bad, were at least “the Almighty to
overthrow Satan. But He remains ever seated in heaven, i.e.
Luther never forgets to impress on man again and again that he
cannot get out of sin: ‘The Saints remain always sinners at
heart.’”</p>

<p>Although, proceeds Köhler, better thoughts, yea, even inspiring
ones, are to be found in Luther’s writings, yet the peculiar
doctrines just spoken of were certainly his own, at utter variance
though they be with our way of looking at the process of individual
salvation, viz. from the psychological point of view,
and of emphasising the personal will to be saved. “In spite of
Luther’s plain and truly evangelical intention of attributing to
God alone all the honour of the work of salvation,” he was never
able “clearly to comprehend the personal, ethico-religious
value of faith”; “on the contrary, he makes man to be shifted
hither and thither, by the hand of God, like a mere pawn, and in
a fashion entirely fatalistic”; “when Christ enters, then,
according to him, all is well; I am no longer a sinner, I am set
free” (“<i>iam ego peccatum non habeo et sum liber</i>”)<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>;&mdash;“but
where does the ethical impulse come in?” Seeing that sin is
merely covered over, and, as a matter of fact, still remains,
man must, according to Luther, “set to work to conquer it
without, however, ever being entirely successful in this task, or
rather he must strengthen his assurance of salvation, viz. his
faith. Such is Luther’s ethics.” The critic rightly points out,
that this “system of ethics is essentially negative,” viz. merely
directs man how “not to fall” from the “pedestal” on which
he is set up together with Christ. Man, by faith, is raised so high,
that, as Luther says, “nothing can prejudice his salvation”;<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>
“Christian freedom means ... that we stand in no need of
any works in order to attain to piety and salvation.”<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></p></div>

<h3>3. Luther’s Admissions Concerning His own
Practice of Virtue</h3>

<p>St. Paul, the far-seeing Apostle of the Gentiles, says of
the ethical effects of the Gospel and of faith: “Those who
are Christ’s have crucified their flesh with the lusts thereof.
If we live in the Spirit let us also walk in the Spirit.” He
instances as the fruits of the Spirit: “Patience, longanimity,
goodness, benignity, mildness, faith, modesty, continency,
chastity” (Gal. v. 22 ff.). Amongst the qualities which must
adorn a teacher and guide of the faithful he instances to
Timothy the following: “It behoveth him to be blameless,
sober, prudent, of good behaviour, chaste, no striker, not
quarrelsome; he must have a good testimony of them that
are without, holding the mystery of the faith in a pure
conscience” (1 Tim. iii. 2 ff.). Finally he sums up all in the
exhortation: “Be thou an example to the faithful in word,
in conversation, in charity, in faith, in chastity” (<i>ibid.</i>, iv.
12).</p>

<p>It seems not unjust to expect of Luther that his standard
of life should be all the higher, since, in opposition to all the
teachers of his day and of bygone ages, and whilst professing
to preach nought but the doctrine of Christ, he had set up a
new system, not merely of faith, but also of morals. At
the very least the power of his Evangel should have manifested
itself in his own person in an exceptional manner.</p>

<p>How far was this the case? What was the opinion of his
contemporaries and what was his own?</p>

<p>Catholics were naturally ever disposed to judge Luther’s
conduct from a standpoint different from that of Luther’s
own followers. A Catholic, devoted to his Church, regarded
as his greatest blemish the conceit of the heresiarch and
devastator of the fold; to him it seemed intolerable that a
disobedient and rebellious son of the Church should display
such pride as to set himself above her and the belief of
antiquity and should attack her so hatefully. As for his
morality, his sacrilegious marriage with a virgin dedicated
to God, his incessant attacks upon celibacy and religious
vows, and his seducing of countless souls to break their
most sacred promises, were naturally sufficient to debase
him in the eyes of most Catholics.</p>

<p>There were, however, certain questions which both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Catholics and Lutherans could ask and answer impartially:
Did Luther possess in any eminent degree the fiducial faith
which he represented as so essential? Did this faith produce
in him those fruits he extols as its spontaneous result, above
all a glad heart at peace with God and man? Further:
How far did he himself come up even to that comparatively
low standard to which, theoretically, he reduced Christian
perfection?</p>

<p>If we seek from Luther’s own lips an estimate of his
virtues, we shall hear from him many frank statements on
the subject.</p>

<p>The first place belongs to what he says of his faith and
personal assurance of salvation.</p>

<p>Of faith, he wrote to Melanchthon, who was tormented
with doubts and uncertainty: “To you and to us all may
God give an increase of faith.... If we have no faith in
us, why not at least comfort ourselves with the faith that
is in others? For there must needs be others who believe
instead of us, otherwise there would be no Church left in the
world, and Christ would have ceased to be with us till the
end of time. If He is not with us, where then is He in the
world?”<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></p>

<p>He complains so frequently of the weakness of his own
faith that we are vividly reminded how greatly he himself
stood in need of the “consolation” of dwelling on the faith
that was in others. He never, it is true, attributes to himself
actual unbelief, or a wilful abandon of trust in the
promises of Christ, yet he does speak in strangely forcible
terms&mdash;and with no mere assumed humility or modesty&mdash;of
the weakness of this faith and of the inconstancy of his
trust.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Of the devil, who unsettles him, he says: “Often I am shaken,
but not always.”<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> To the devil it was given to play the part of
torturer. “I prefer the tormentor of the body to the torturer of
the soul.”<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>&mdash;“Alas, the Apostles believed, of this there can be
no doubt; I can’t believe, and yet I preach faith to others. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
know that it is true, yet believe it I cannot.”<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> “I know Jonas,
and if he [like Christ] were to ascend to heaven and disappear out
of our sight, what should I then think? And when Peter said:
‘In the name of Jesus, arise’ [Acts iii. 6], what a marvel that
was! I don’t understand it and I can’t believe it; and yet all
the Apostles believed.”<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></p>

<p>“I have been preaching for these twenty years, and read and
written, so that I ought to see my way ... and yet I cannot
grasp the fact, that I must rely on grace alone; and still, otherwise
it cannot be, for the mercy-seat alone must count and
remain since God has established it; short of this no man can
reach God. Hence it is no wonder that others find it so hard
to accept faith in its purity, more particularly when these devil-preachers
[the Papists] add to the difficulty by such texts as:
‘Do this and thou shalt live,’ item ‘Wilt thou enter into life,
keep the commandments’ (Luke x. 28; Matthew xix. 17).”<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>

<p>He is unable to find within him that faith which, according
to his system, ought to exist, and, in many passages, he even
insists on its difficulty in a very curious manner. “Ah, dear
child, if only one could believe firmly,” he said to his little
daughter, who “was speaking of Christ with joyful confidence”;
and, in answer to the question, “whether then he did not believe,”
he replied by praising the innocence and strong faith of children,
whose example Christ bids us follow.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>

<p>In the notes among which these words are preserved there
follows a collection of similar statements belonging to various
periods: “This argument, ‘The just shall live in his faith’
(Hab. ii. 4), the devil is unable to explain away. But the point
is, who is able to lay hold on it?”<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>&mdash;“I, alas, cannot believe as
firmly as I can preach, speak and write, and as others fancy I
am able to believe.”<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>&mdash;When the Apostle of the Gentiles speaks
of dying daily (1 Cor. xv. 31), this means, so Luther thinks, that
he had doubts about his own teaching. In the same way Christ
withdraws Himself from him, Luther, “so that at times I say:
Truly I know not where I stand, or whether I am preaching
aright or not.”<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> “I used to believe all that the Pope and the
monks said, but now I am unable to believe what Christ says,
Who cannot lie. This is an annoying business, but we shall keep
it for that [the Last] Day.”<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>

<p>“Conscience’s greatest consolation,” he also says, according
to the same notes, “is simply the Lord Christ,” and he proceeds
to describe in detail this consolation in language of much power,
agreeably with his doctrine of Justification. He, however,
concludes: “But I cannot grasp this consoling doctrine, I can
neither learn it nor bear it in mind.”<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

<p>“I am very wretched owing to the weakness of my faith;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
hardly can I find any comfort in the death and resurrection
of Christ, or in the article of the forgiveness of sins.... I
cannot succeed in laying hold on the essential treasure, viz.
the free forgiveness of sins.”<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></p>

<p>“It is a difficult matter to spring straight from my sins to
the righteousness of Christ, and to be as certain that Christ’s
righteousness is mine as I am that my own body is mine....
I am astonished that I cannot learn this doctrine.”<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></p>

<p>In a passage already quoted Luther rightly described the task
he assigned to grace and faith as something “which affrights a
man,” for which reason it is “hard for him to believe”; he
himself had often, so to speak, to fight his way out of hell, “but
it costs much before one obtains consolation.”</p>

<p>Such statements we can well understand if we put ourselves in
his place. The effects he ascribed to fiducial faith were so
difficult of attainment and so opposed to man’s natural disposition,
that never-ending uncertainty was the result, both in
his own case and in that of many others. Moreover, he, or rather
his peculiar interpretation of Holy Scripture, was the only
guarantee of his doctrine, whereas the Catholic Church took her
stand upon the broad and firm basis of a settled, traditional
interpretation, and traced back her teaching to an authority
instituted by God and equipped with infallibility. In his “temptations
of faith,” Luther clung to the most varied arguments,
dwelling at one time on the fact of his election, at another on the
depravity of his opponents, now on the malice of the devil sent
to oppose him, now on the supposed advantages of his doctrine,
as for instance, that it gave all the honour to God alone and
made an end of everything human, even of free will: “Should
Satan take advantage of this and ally himself with the flesh and
with reason, then conscience becomes affrighted and despairs,
unless you resolutely enter into yourself and say: Even should
Cyprian, Ambrose, Augustine, St. Peter, Paul, John, nay, an
angel from heaven, teach otherwise, yet I know for a certainty
that what I teach is not human but divine, i.e. that I ascribe all
to God and nothing to man.”<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></p>

<p>“I do not understand it, I am unable to believe ... I cannot
believe and yet I teach others. I know that it is right and yet
believe it I cannot. Sometimes I think: You teach the truth,
for you have the office and vocation, you are of assistance to
many and glorify Christ; for we do not preach Aristotle or
Cæsar, but Jesus Christ. But when I consider my weakness,
how I eat and drink and am considered a merry fellow, then I
begin to doubt. Alas, if one could only believe!”<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></p>

<p>“Heretics believe themselves to be holy. I find not a scrap
of holiness in myself, but only great weakness. As soon as I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
assailed by temptation I understand the Spirit, but nevertheless
the flesh resists. [That is] idolatry against the first table [of the
law]. Gladly would I be formally just, but I am not conscious
of being so.”</p>

<p>And Pomeranus replied: “Neither am I conscious of it, Herr
Doctor.”<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Before passing on to some of Luther’s statements concerning
the consonance of his life with faith, we may
remark that there is no lack of creditable passages in his
writings on the conforming of ethics to faith. Although here
our task is not to depict in its entirety the morality of Luther
and his doctrine, but merely to furnish an historical answer
to the question whether there existed in him elements which
rendered his claim to a higher mission incredible, still we
must not forget his many praiseworthy exhortations to
virtue, intended, moreover, not merely for others, but also
for himself.</p>

<p>That the devil must be resisted and that his tricks and
temptations lead to what is evil, has been insisted upon by
few preachers so frequently as by Luther, who in almost
every address, every chapter of his works, and every letter
treats of the sinister power of the devil. Another favourite,
more positive theme of his discourses, whether to the
members of his household or to the larger circle of the public,
was the domestic virtues and the cheerful carrying out of the
duties of one’s calling. He was also fond, in the sermons he
was so indefatigable in preaching, of bringing home to those
oppressed with the burden of life’s troubles the consolation
of certain evangelical truths, and of breaking the bread of
the Word to the little ones and the unlearned. With the
utmost earnestness he sought to awaken trust in God,
resignation to His Providence, hope in His Mercy and Bounty
and the confession of our own weakness. One idea on which
he was particularly fond of lingering, was, that we must pray
because we depend entirely upon God, and that we must put
aside all confidence in ourselves in order that we may be
filled with His Grace.</p>

<p>Unfortunately such thoughts too often brought him
back to his own pet views of man’s passivity and
absence of free will and the all-effecting power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
God. “The game is always won,” he cries, “and if
it is won there is no longer any pain or trouble more;
there is no need to struggle and fight, for all has already
been accomplished.”<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> “Christ, the Conqueror, has done all,
so that there is nothing left for us to do, to root out sin, to slay
the devil or to overcome death; they all have been trampled
to the ground.... The doing was not, however, our
work.”<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>&mdash;“The Christian’s work is to sleep and do nothing”;
thus does he sum up in one of his sermons the exhortations
he had previously given to rest altogether on the merits of
Christ; even should a man “fall into sin and be up to the
neck in it, let him remember that Christ is no taker, but a
most gracious giver”; this is “a very sweet and cheering
doctrine; others, it is true, teach that you must do so much
for sin, must live in this or that way, since God must be paid
to the last farthing before you can appear before Him. Such
people make of God a torturer and taskmaster.”<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> After
having recommended prayer he inveighs against what he calls
its abuse: “They say: I will pray until God gives me His
Grace; but nothing comes of it, because God says to them:
You cannot and never will be able to do anything; but I
shall do everything.” “Everything through Christ:
through works, nothing whatever.”<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Luther has some remarkable admissions to make, particularly
in his private utterances, concerning the manner in
which he himself and his chosen circle lived their faith.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I cannot express in words what great pains I took in the
Papacy to be righteous. Now, however, I have ceased entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
to be careful, because I have come to the insight and belief that
another has become righteous before God in my stead.”<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></p>

<p>“My doctrine stands whatever [my] life may be.”<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></p>

<p>“Let us stick to the true Word that the seat of Moses may be
ours. Even should our manner of life not be altogether polished
and perfect, yet God is merciful; the laity, however, hate us.”<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></p>

<p>“Neither would it be a good thing were we to do all that God
commands, for in that case He would be cheated of His Godhead,
and the Our Father, faith, the article of the forgiveness of sins,
etc., would all go to ruin. God would be made a liar. He would
no longer be the one and only truth, and every man would not be
a liar [as Scripture says]. Should any man say: ‘If this is so,
God will be but little served on earth’ [I reply]: He is accustomed
to that; He wills to be, and is, a God of great mercy.”<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

<p>“I want to hand over a downright sinner to the Judgment
Seat of our Lord God; for though I myself may not have actually
been guilty of adultery, still that has not been for lack of good-will.”<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>&mdash;The
latter phrase was a saying of the populace, and does
not in the least mean that he ever really had the intention of
committing the sin.</p>

<p>“I confess of myself,” he says in a sermon in 1532, “and
doubtless others must admit the same [of themselves], that I
lack the diligence and earnestness of which really I ought to have
much more than formerly; that I am much more careless than
I was under the Papacy; and that now, under the Evangel,
there is nowhere the same zeal to be found as before.” This he
declares to be due to the devil and to people’s carelessness, but
not to his teaching.<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">On other occasions he admits of his party as a whole,
more particularly of its leaders, viz. the theologians and
Princes, that they fell more or less short of what was required
for a Christian life; among them he expressly includes himself:
“It is certain with regard to ourselves and our Princes
that we are not clean and holy, and the Princes have vices
of their own. But Christ loves a frank and downright confession.”<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a></p>

<p>Among such “confessions” made by Luther we find
some concerning prayer.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Comparing the present with the past he says: “People are
now so cold and pray so seldom”; this he seeks to explain by
urging that formerly people were more “tormented by the
devil.”<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> A better explanation is that which he gave in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Commentary on Galatians: “For the more confident we are of
the freedom Christ has won for us, the colder and lazier we are
in teaching the Word, praying, doing good and enduring contradictions.”<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></p>

<p>We possess some very remarkable and even spirited exhortations
to prayer from Luther’s pen; on occasion he would also
raise his own voice in prayer to implore God’s assistance with
feeling, fervour and the greatest confidence, particularly when in
anxiety and trouble about his undertaking. (See vol. iv., xxv.
3.) He refers frequently to his daily prayer, though he admits
that the heretics, i.e. the Anabaptists, also were in the habit of
praying&mdash;in their own way. His excessive labours and the
turmoil of his life’s struggle left him, however, little time and
quiet for prayer, particularly for interior prayer. Besides, he
considered the canonical hours of the Catholics mere “bawling,”
and the liturgical devices for raising the heart mere imposture.
During the latter years he spent in the cloister outside cares
left him no leisure for the prayers which he was, as a religious,
bound to recite. Finally, towards the end of his life, he often
enough admits that his prayers were cold.<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> Frequently he was
obliged to stimulate his ardour for prayer as well as work by
“anger and zeal”;<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> “for no man can say,” as he puts it, “how
hard a thing it is to pray from the heart.”<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a></p>

<p>Even in the early part of his career he had deliberately and on
principle excluded one important sort of prayer, viz. prayer for
help in such interior trials as temptations against the celibacy
enjoined by the religious state, which he came to persuade himself
was an impossibility and contrary to the Will of God. Then, if
ever, did he stand in need of the weapon of prayer, but we read
nowhere in his letters, written in that gloomy period, of his
imploring God humbly for light and strength. On the contrary,
he writes, in 1521: “What if this prayer is not according to
God’s Will, or if He does not choose to grant it when it is addressed
to Him?”<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> He ironically attacks those who rightly said that “we
must implore in all things the grace of God, that He denies it to
none,” and, that, with God’s grace, it was possible to keep the
vows. He replies to “these simple people and those who care
nothing for souls”: “Excellent! Why did you not advise St.
Peter to ask God that he might not be bound by Herod?”
“That,” he says, “is to make a mockery of serious matters”
(“<i>est modus ludendi</i>”)<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>&mdash;a censure which might very well have
been flung back at such a teacher of prayer.</p>

<p>Seventeen years later he gave the following advice on prayer:
“We must not curse, that is true, but pray we must that God’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
name be hallowed and honoured, and the Pope’s execrated and
cursed together with his god, the devil; that God’s Kingdom
come, and that End-Christ’s kingdom perish. Such a ‘paternosteral’
curse may well be breathed, and so should every
Christian pray.”<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> That the Pope be “cursed, damned, dishonoured
and destroyed, etc.,” such was his “daily, never-ending,
heartfelt prayer, as it was of all those who believe in
Christ,” so he assures us, “and I feel that my prayer is heard.”<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>
His opinion is that it is impossible to pray for anything without
“cursing,” i.e. excluding the opposite. “Someone asked Dr.
Martin Luther whether he who prayed thus must curse. ‘Yes,’
he replied, ‘for when I pray “Hallowed be Thy Name,” I curse
Erasmus and all heretics who dishonour and blaspheme God.’”<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>
His anger against the devil often broke out in his prayers.
“Though I cannot read or write,” he writes to Melanchthon
from the Coburg, “I can still think, and pray, and rage
(‘<i>debacchari</i>’) against the devil.”<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a></p>

<p>He ought to “offer incense to God,” he complains on one
occasion in 1538 in his “Table-Talk,” but, instead, he brings Him
“stinking pitch and devil’s ordure by his murmuring and impatience.”
“It is thus that I frequently worship my God....
Had we not the article of the forgiveness of sins, which God has
firmly promised, our case would indeed be bad.”<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> Again and
again does he cast his anchor on this article when threatened by
the storms.</p></div>

<p class="p1">His private, non-polemical religious exercises seem to
have been exceedingly brief: “I have to do violence to
myself daily in order to pray, and I am satisfied to repeat,
when I go to bed, the Ten Commandments, the Our Father
and then a verse or two; while thinking these over I fall
asleep.”<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> Unusual, and at the same time peculiar, were the
prayers which we hear of his offering with the intention of
doing some wholesome ill to his neighbour, or even of bringing
about the latter’s death in the interests of the Evangel.
In a sermon on July 23, 1531, after reprimanding certain
Wittenberg brewers, who, in the hope of adding to their
profits, were accustomed to adulterate their beer, he says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
“Unless you mend your ways, we shall pray that your malt
may turn to muck and sewage. Don’t forget that.”<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The Christian’s life of faith ought not merely to be penetrated
with the spirit of prayer but, in spite of all crosses
and the temptations from earthy things, to move along the
safe path of peace and joy of heart. Luther must have
found much concerning “peace and joy in the Holy Ghost”
in his favourite Epistle to the Romans. He himself says:
“A Christian must be a joyful man.... Christ says,
‘Peace be with you; let not your heart be troubled: have
confidence, I have overcome the world.’ It is the will of
God that you be joyful.”</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Of himself, however, he is forced to add: “I preach and write
this, but I have not yet acquired the art when tempted the other
way. This is in order that we may be instructed,” so he reassures
himself. “Were we always at peace, the devil would
get the better of us.... The fact is we are not equal to the holy
Fathers in the matter of faith. The further we fall short of them
[this is another of his consolations], the greater is the victory
Christ will win; for in the struggle with the devil we are the
meanest, most stupid of foes, and he has a great advantage over
us.... Our Lord has determined to bring about the end [the
impending end of all] amidst universal foolishness.”<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> Thus,
according to him, the victory of Christ would be exalted all
the more by the absence of peace and joy amongst His followers.</p></div>

<p class="p1">What do we see of pious effort on his part, more particularly
in the matter of preparation for the sacraments,
and repressing of self?</p>

<p>The spiritual life was to him a passive compliance with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the faith which God Himself was to awaken and preserve
in the heart.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">For “this is how it takes place,” he says, in a carefully considered
instruction, “God’s Word comes to me without any co-operation
on my part. I may, it is true, do this much, go and
hear it, read it, or preach it, so that it may sink into my heart.
And this is the real preparation which lies not in man’s powers
and ability, but in the power of God. Hence there is no better
preparation on our part for all the sacraments than to suffer
God to work in us. This is a brief account of the preparation.”<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></p>

<p>Yet he himself perceived the peril of teaching that “those
people were fit to receive the sacrament whose hearts had been
touched by the Word of God so that they believed, and that
whoever did not feel himself thus moved should remain away.”
He says: “I remark in many, myself included, how the evil
spirit, by insisting too much upon the right side, makes people
lazy and slow to receive the sacrament, and that they refuse to
come unless they feel assured that their faith has been enkindled.
This also is dangerous.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless he will have no “self-preparation”; such
preparation, “by means of one’s own works,” appeared to him
Popish; it was loathsome to God, and the doctrine of “faith
alone” should be retained, even though “reason be unable to
understand it.”<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> Hence it is not surprising that he declared it
to be a dreadful “error and abuse” that we should venture to
prepare ourselves for the sacrament by our own efforts, as those
do who strive to make themselves worthy to receive the sacrament
by confession and other works.<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a></p>

<p>He storms at those priests who require contrition from the
sinner who makes his confession; his opinion is that they are
mad, and that, instead of the keys, they were better able to wield
pitchforks.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> Even “were Christ Himself to come and speak to
you as He did to Moses and say, ‘What hast thou done?’ kill
Him on the spot.”<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> “Contrition only gives rise to despair, and
insults God more than it appeases Him.”<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> Such language may
be explained by the fact, that, in his theory, contrition is merely
consternation and terror at God’s wrath produced by the accusations
of the law; the troubled soul ought really to take refuge
behind the Gospel.&mdash;How entirely different had been the preparation
recommended by the Church in previous ages for the reception
of the sacraments! She indeed enjoined contrition, but as
an interior act issuing in love and leading to the cleansing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
soul. According to Luther, however, excessive purity of soul
was not advisable, and only led to presumption. “The devil
is a holy fellow,” he had said, “and has no need of Christ and
His Grace”; “Christ dwells only in sinners.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, in many fine passages, he recommends self-denial
and mortification as a check upon concupiscence. He
even uses the word “<i>mortificare</i>,” and insists that, till our last
breath, we must not cease to dread the “<i>fomes</i>” of the flesh and
dishonourable temptations. He alone walks safely, so he repeatedly
affirms, who keeps his passions under the dominion of
the Spirit, suffers injustice, resists the attacks of pride, and at the
same time holds his body in honour as the chaste temple of God
by denying it much that its evil lusts desire.</p>

<p>Luther himself, however, does not seem to have been overmuch
given to mortification, whether of the senses or of the inner
man. He was less notable for his earnest efforts to restrain the
passions than for that “openness to all the world had to offer,”
and that “readiness to taste to the full the joy of living,” which
his followers admire. Not only was he averse to penitential
exercises, but he even refused to regulate his diet: “I eat just
what I like and bear the pains afterwards as best I can.” “To
live by the doctor’s rule is to live wretchedly.” “I cannot
comply with the precautions necessary to ensure health; later on,
remedies may do what they can.”<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> “I don’t consult the doctors,
for I don’t mean to embitter the one year of life which they
allow me, and I prefer to eat and drink in God’s name what I
fancy.”<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> With his reference to his “tippling” and the “Good
drink” we shall deal at greater length below, in section 5.</p></div>

<p class="p1">The aim of Luther’s ethics, as is plain from the above, did
not rise above the level of mediocrity. His practice, to
judge from what has been already said, involved the renunciation
of any effort after the attainment of eminent
virtue. It may, however, be questioned whether he was
really true even to the low standard he set himself.</p>

<p>There is a certain downward tendency in the system of
mediocrity which drags one ever lower. Such a system
carries with it the rejection of all effort to become ever more
and more pleasing to God, such as religion must necessarily
foster if it is to realise its vocation, and to which those
countless souls who were capable of higher things have,
under the influence of Divine grace, ever owed their progress.
The indispensable and noblest dowry of true piety is the
moulding of spiritual heroes, of men capable of overcoming
the world and all material things. Thousands of less highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
endowed souls, under the impulse from above, hasten to follow
them, seeking the glory of God, and comfort amidst the
troubles of life, in religion and the zealous practice of virtue.
Mighty indeed, when transformed by them into glowing
deeds, were the watch words of the Church’s Saints: “I
was born for higher things,” “All for the greater glory of
God,” “Conquer thyself,” “Suffer and fight with courage
and confidence.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, the system of mediocrity, organised
yielding to weakness, and the setting up of the lowest possible
ethical standard, could not be expected to furnish Luther
and his disciples with any very high religious motive. Even
in the ordinary domain of Christian life Luther’s too easy
and over-confident doctrine of the appropriation of the
satisfaction made by Christ, sounds very different from our
Saviour’s exhortations: “Do penance, for the kingdom of
heaven is at hand”; “Whoever will come after Me, let him
deny himself”; “Whoever does not take up his cross and
follow Me cannot be My disciple”; or from those of St. Paul
who said of himself, that the world was crucified to him and
he to the world; or from those of St. Peter: “Seeing
that Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with
the like mind.” “Do penance and be converted,
that your sins may be blotted out.” What Scripture
requires of the faithful is not blind, mechanical confidence
in the merits of Christ as a cloak for our sins, but “fruits
worthy of penance.” In the long list of Luther’s works we
seek in vain for a commentary which brings these solemn
statements on penance before the mind of the reader with
the emphasis hitherto habitual. Even were such a commentary
forthcoming, the living commentary of his own
life, which is the seal of the preacher’s words, would still
be wanting.</p>

<p>On another point, viz. zeal for the souls of others, we see
no less clearly how far Luther was removed from the ideal.
True zeal for souls embraces all without exception, more
particularly those who have gone astray and who must be
brought to see the light and to be saved. Luther, on the
other hand, again and again restricts most curiously the
circle to whom his Evangel is to be preached; the wide
outlook of the great preachers of the faith in the Church
of olden days was not his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Three classes do not belong to the Evangel at all,” he had
said, “and to them we do not preach.... Away with the dissolute
swine.” The three classes thus stigmatised were, first the
“rude hearts,” who “will not accept the Evangel nor observe its
behests”; secondly, “coarse knaves steeped in great vices,”
who would not allow themselves to be bitten by the Evangel;
thirdly, “the worst of all, who, beyond this, even dare to persecute
the Evangel.” The Evangel is, as a matter of fact, intended only
for “simple souls ... and to none other have we preached.”<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>
This explains why Luther long cherished the idea of forming
a kind of esoteric Church, or community consisting simply of
religiously disposed faithful; unfortunately “he did not find
such people,”<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> for most were content to neglect both Church and
Sacraments.</p>

<p>The older Church had exhorted all who held a cure of souls to
be zealous in seeking out such as had become careless or hostile.
When, however, someone asked Luther, in 1540, how to behave
towards those who had never been inside a church for about
twenty years, he replied: “Let them go to the devil, and, when
they die, pitch them on the manure-heap.”</p>

<p>The zeal for souls displayed by Luther was zeal for his own
peculiar undertaking, viz. for the Evangel which he preached.
Zeal for the general spread of the kingdom of God amongst the
faithful, and amongst those still sunk in unbelief, was with him
a very secondary consideration.</p>

<p>In reality his zeal was almost exclusively directed against the
Papacy.</p></div>

<p class="p1">The idea of a universal Church, which just then was
inspiring Catholics to undertake the enormous missionary
task of converting the newly discovered continents, stood,
in Luther’s case, very much in the background.</p>

<p>Though, in part, this may be explained by his struggle for
the introduction of the innovations into those portions of
Germany nearest to him, yet the real reason was his surrender
of the old ecclesiastical ideal, his transformation of the
Church into an invisible kingdom of souls devoted to the
Evangel, and his destruction of the older conception of
Christendom with its two hinges, viz. the Papacy established
for the spiritual and the Empire for the temporal welfare of
the family of nations. He saw little beyond Saxony, the
land favoured by the preaching of the new Gospel, and
Germany, to which he had been sent as a “prophet.” The
Middle Ages, though so poor in means of communication and
geographical knowledge, compared with that age of discovery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
was, thanks to its great Catholic, i.e. world-embracing
ideas, inspired with an enthusiasm for the kingdom
of God which found no place in the ideals of Lutheranism.
We may compare, for instance, the heroic efforts of
those earlier days to stem the incursions of the Eastern
infidel with the opinion expressed by the Wittenberg
professor on the war against the Crescent, where he declared
the resistance offered in the name of Christendom to the
Turks to be “contrary to the will of the Holy Ghost,” an
opinion which he continued to hold, in spite of, or perhaps
rather because of, its condemnation by the Pope (p. 76 ff.,
and p. 92). We may contrast the eloquent appeals of the
preachers of the Crusades&mdash;inspired by the danger which
threatened from the East&mdash;for the delivery of the Holy Land
and the Holy Sepulchre, with Luther’s statement quoted
above, that God troubled as little about the Tomb at
Jerusalem as He did about the Swiss cows (p. 168). In
Luther’s thoughts the boundaries of the Christian world
have suddenly become much less extensive than in the
Middle Ages, whilst ecclesiastical interests, thanks to the
new territorial rights of the Princes, tend to be limited by
the frontiers of the petty States.<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a></p>

<p>The stormy nature of the work on which his energies
were spent could not fail to impress on his personal character
a stamp of its own. In considering Luther’s ethical peculiarities,
we are not at liberty to pass over in silence the
feverish unrest&mdash;so characteristic of him and so unlike the
calm and joyous determination evinced by true messengers
sent by God&mdash;the blind and raging vehemence, which not
only suited the violence of his natural disposition, but which
he constantly fostered by his actions. “The Lord is not in
the storm”; these words, found in the history of the Prophet
Elias, do not seem to have been Luther’s subject of meditation.
He himself, characteristically enough, speaks of his
life-work as one long “tally-ho.” He was never content
save when worrying others or being worried himself; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
always required some object which he could pull to pieces,
whereas true men of God are accustomed to proceed quietly,
according to a fixed plan, and in the light of some great
supernatural principle. With Luther excitement, confusion
and war were a second nature. “The anger and rage
of my enemies is my joy and delight, in spite of all their
attempts to take it from me and defraud me of it.... To
hell-fire with such flowers and fruits, for that is where they
belong!”<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></p>

<p class="p2">If, after listening to utterances such as the above, we
proceed to visit Luther in his domestic circle&mdash;as we shall
in the next section&mdash;we may well be surprised at the totally
different impression given by the man. In the midst of his
own people Luther appears in a much more peaceable guise.</p>

<p>He sought to fulfil his various duties as father of the
family, towards his children, the servants and the numerous
guests who lived in or frequented his house, whether relatives
or others, so far as his occupations permitted. He was
affable in his intercourse with them, sympathetic, benevolent
and kind-hearted towards those who required his help, and
easily satisfied with his material circumstances. All these
and many other redeeming points in his character will be
treated of more in detail later. It is true that the ceaseless
labours to which he gave himself up caused him to overlook
many abuses at his home which were apparent to others.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">The unrest, noise and bustle which reigned in Luther’s house,
were, at a later date, objected to by many outsiders. George
Held wrote in 1542 to George of Anhalt, who had thought of
taking up his abode with Luther, to dissuade him from doing so:
“Luther’s house is tenanted by a miscellaneous crowd (‘<i>miscellanea
et promiscua turba</i>’) of students, girls, widows, old women
and beardless boys, hence great unrest prevails there; many
good men are distressed at this on account of the Reverend
Father [Luther]. Were all animated by Luther’s spirit, then
his house would prove a comfortable and pleasant abode for
you for a few days, and you would have an opportunity of enjoying
his familiar discourses, but, seeing how his house is at present
conducted, I would not advise you to take up your quarters
there.”<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Many of Luther’s friends and acquaintances were also dissatisfied
with Catherine Bora, because of a certain sway she
seemed to exercise over Luther, even outside the family circle,
in matters both great and small. In a passage which was not
made public until 1907 we find Johann Agricola congratulating
himself, in 1544, on Luther’s favourable disposition towards
him: “Domina Ketha, the arbitress of Heaven and Earth, who
rules her husband as she pleases, has, for once, put in a good
word on my behalf.”<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> The assertion of Caspar Cruciger, a friend
of the family, where he speaks of Catherine as the “firebrand in
the house,” and also the report given to the Elector by the
Chancellor Brück, who accuses her of a domineering spirit, were
already known before.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> Luther’s own admissions, to which we
shall return later, plainly show that there was some truth in
these complaints. The latest Protestant to write the life of
Catherine Bora, after pointing out that she was vivacious,
garrulous and full of hatred for her husband’s enemies, says:
“The influence of such a temperament, united with such strength
of character, could not fail to be evil rather than good, and for
this both wife and husband suffered.... We cannot but allow
that Katey at times exerted a powerful influence over Luther.”
Particularly in moving him in the direction in which he was
already leaning, “her power over him was great.”<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a></p>

<p>Luther’s son Hans was long a trial to the family, and his
father occasionally vents his ire on the youth for his disobedience
and laziness. He finally sent him to Torgau, where he might be
more carefully trained and have his behaviour corrected. Hans
seems to have been spoilt by his mother. Later on she spoke of
him as untalented, and as a “silly fellow,” who would be laughed
at were he to enter the Chancery of the Elector.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> A niece,
Magdalene Kaufmann, whom Luther brought up in his house
together with two other young relatives,<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> was courted by Veit
Dietrich, one of Luther’s pupils, who also boarded with him.
This was, however, discountenanced by the master of the house,
who declared that the wench “was not yet sufficiently educated.”
Luther was annoyed at her want of obedience and ended by
telling her that, should she not prove more tractable, he would
marry her to a “grimy charcoal-burner.” His opposition to the
match with Dietrich brought about strained relations between
himself and one who had hitherto been entirely devoted to him.
Dietrich eventually found another partner and was congratulated
by Luther. Magdalene, with Luther’s consent, married, first,
Ambrose Berndt, an official of the University, and, after his
death in 1541, accepted the proposal of Reuchlin, a young
physician only twenty years of age, whom she married in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
of Luther’s displeasure. With her restlessness she had sorely
troubled the peace of the household.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></p>

<p>Other complaints were due to the behaviour of Hans Polner,
the son of Luther’s sister, who was studying theology, but who
nevertheless frequently returned home the worse for drink and
was given to breaking out into acts of violence.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> Another nephew,
Fabian Kaufmann, seems to have been the culprit who caused
Luther to grumble that someone in his own house had been
secretly betrothed at the very time when, in his bitter controversy
with the lawyers, he was denouncing such “clandestine
marriages” as invalid.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> Finally, one of the servant-girls, named
Rosina, gave great scandal by her conduct, concerning which
Luther has some strong things to say in his letters.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></p>

<p>The quondam Augustinian priory at Wittenberg, which has
often been praised as the ideal of a Protestant parsonage, fell
considerably short, in point of fact, even of Luther’s own standard.
There lacked the supervision demanded by the freedom accorded
to the numerous inmates, whether relatives or boarders, of the
famous “Black monastery.”</p></div>


<h3>4. The Table-Talk and the First Notes of the same</h3>

<p>At the social gatherings of his friends and pupils, Luther
was fond of giving himself up unrestrainedly to mirth and
jollity. His genius, loquacity and good-humour made him a
“merry boon companion,” whose society was much appreciated.
Often, it is true, he was very quiet and thoughtful.
His guests little guessed, nay, perhaps he himself was not
fully aware, how often his cheerfulness and lively sallies
were due to the desire to repress thereby the sad and
anxious thoughts which troubled him.</p>

<p>Liveliness and versatility, imagination and inventiveness,
a good memory and a facile tongue were some of the gifts
with which nature had endowed him. To these already
excellent qualities must be added that depth of feeling
which frequently finds expression in utterances of surprising
beauty interspersed among his more profane sayings.
Unfortunately, owing to his incessant conflicts and to the
trivialities to which his pen and tongue were so prone,
this better side of his character did not emerge as fully as
it deserved.</p>

<p>In order to become better acquainted with the conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
amid which Luther lived at Wittenberg, we must betake
ourselves to a room in the former Augustinian convent,
where we shall find him seated, after the evening meal,
amidst friends such as Melanchthon, Bugenhagen and
Jonas, surrounded by eager students&mdash;for the most part
boarders in his house, the former “Black monastery”&mdash;and
strangers who had travelled to the little University town
attracted by the fame of the Evangel. There it is that he
imparts his views and relates his interior experiences in all
confidence. He was perfectly aware that what he said was
being noted down, and sometimes suggested that one
saying or the other should be carefully committed to
writing.<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> The older group of friends (1529-1535), to whom
we owe relations of the Table-Talk, comprised Conrad
Cordatus, Veit Dietrich, Johann Schlaginhaufen, Anton
Lauterbach, Hieronymus Weller and Anton Corvinus;
such of these as remained with him from 1536 to 1539
form the middle group; the last (1540-1546) was chiefly
made up of Johann Mathesius, Caspar Heydenreich,
Hieronymus Besold, Master Plato, Johann Stoltz and Johann
Aurifaber. Apart from these there were a few who came
into close, personal contact with Luther, for instance,
George Rörer, who assisted him in translating the Bible
and who is one of Aurifaber’s authorities for the Table-Talk.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>In his twelfth Sermon on the “Historien von des
ehrwürdigen ... Manns Gottes Martini Lutheri,” etc.,
Mathesius was later on to write that he had enjoyed at his
table “many good colloquies and chats” and had tasted
“much excellent stuff in the shape of writings and counsels.”<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>
Luther himself refers incidentally to these social evenings
in his famous saying, that, while he “drank Wittenberg
beer with his friends Philip and Amsdorf,” God, by his
means, had weakened the Papacy and brought it nigh to
destruction.<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> The wine was drunk&mdash;at least on solemn
occasions&mdash;from the famous bowl known as the “Catechismusglas,”
on which were painted in sections, placed one
below the other and separated by three ridges, various
portions of Christian doctrine: at the top the Ten Commandments,
in the middle the Creed and Our Father, and
at the bottom the whole Catechism (probably the superscriptions
and numbers of the questions in the Catechism).
We read in the Table-Talk, that, on one occasion, Johann
Agricola could get only as far as the Ten Commandments
at one draught, whereas Luther was able to empty the bowl
right off down to the very dregs, i.e. “Catechism and
all.”<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a></p>

<p>For Luther’s sayings given in what follows we have made
use of the so-called original versions of the Table-Talk recently
edited by various Protestant scholars, viz. the Diaries of
Lauterbach and Cordatus, the notes of Schlaginhaufen and
the Collections made by Mathesius and found in the
“Aufzeichnungen” edited by Loesche and in the “Tischreden
(Mathesius)” published more recently still by Kroker,
the Leipzig librarian.<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>The objection has frequently been raised that the Table-Talk
ought not to be made use of as a reliable source of
information for the delineation of Luther’s person. It is,
however, remarkable that the chapters which are favourable
to Luther are referred to and exploited in Protestant
histories, only that which is disagreeable being usually
excluded as historically inaccurate. The fact is that we
have merely to comply conscientiously with the rules of
historical criticism when utilising the information contained
in the Table-Talk, which, owing to its fulness and variety,
never fails to rivet attention. These rules suggest that we
should give the preference to those statements which recur
frequently under a similar form; that we should not take
mere questions, put forward by Luther simply to invite
discussion and correction, as conveying his real thought;
that we consult the original notes, if possible those made at
the time of the conversation, and that, where there is a
discrepancy between the accounts (a rare occurrence), we
should prefer those which date from before the time when
Luther’s pupils arranged and classified his sayings according
to subjects. The chronological arrangement of Luther’s
sayings has thereby suffered, and here and there the text
has been altered. For this reason the Latin tradition,
as we have it, for instance, from Lauterbach’s pen,<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> ranks
before the German version, which is of slightly later
date. Kroker’s new edition, when complete, promises to
be the best.</p>

<p>If the rules of historical criticism are followed in this
and other points there is no reason why the historian
should not thankfully avail himself of this great fount of
information, which the first collectors themselves extolled
as the most valuable authority on the spirit of their master
“of pious and holy memory,”<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> and as likely to prove both
instructive and edifying to a later generation. The doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
as to the reliability of the notes has been well answered by
Kroker: “Such distrust, so far as the original documents
are concerned, can now no longer stand. In his rendering
of Luther’s words Mathesius, and likewise Heydenreich,
Besold and Weller, whose notes his Collection also embodies,
does not differ substantially from the older table companions,
Dietrich, Schlaginhaufen and Lauterbach. All these men
did their utmost to render Luther’s sayings faithfully and
to the best of their knowledge and ability.”<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></p>

<p>The spontaneous character of the Table-Talk gives it
a peculiar value of its own. “These [conversations] are
children of the passing moment, reliable witnesses to the
prevailing mood” (Adolf Hausrath). In intercourse with
intimates our ideas and feelings express themselves much
more spontaneously and naturally than where the pen of the
letter-writer is being guided by reflection, and seeks to make
a certain impression on the mind of his reader. But if even
letters are no faithful index to our thought, how much less
so are prints, intended for the perusal of thousands and
even to outlive the writer’s age? On the other hand, it is
true that the deliberation which accompanies the use of the
pen, imparts, in a certain sense, to the written word a higher
value than is possessed by the spoken word. We should,
however, expect to find in a man occupying such a position
as Luther’s a standard sufficiently high to ensure the
presence of deliberation and judgment even in ordinary
conversation.</p>

<p>Among the valuable statements made by Luther, which
on account of their very nature were unsuited for public
utterance but have been faithfully transmitted in the Table-Talk,
we have, for instance, certain criticisms of friends
and even patrons in high places. Such reflections could not
well be uttered save in the privacy of his domestic circle,
but, for this very reason, they may well be prized by the
historian. Then we have his candid admissions concerning
himself, for instance, that his fear lest the Landgrave of Hesse
should fall away from the cause of the Evangel constituted
one of the motives which led him to sanction this Prince’s
bigamy. Then, again, there is the account of his mental
trouble, due to certain external events, of the influence of
biblical passages, old memories, etc. Finally, we have his
strange counsels concerning resistance to temptation, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
own example held up as a consolation to the faint-hearted,
to those who wavered in the faith or were inclined to
despair; his excuse for a “good drink,” his curious recipe
for counteracting the evil done by witches at home, and
many other statements of an intimate nature which were
quite unsuitable for public writings or even for letters.
All this, and much more, offers the unprejudiced observer
an opportunity for knowing Luther better. It is true that
all is not the Word of God; this Luther himself states in a
passage which has been wrongly brought forward in excuse
of the Table-Talk: “I must admit that I say many things
which are not the Word of God, when speaking outside my
office of preacher, at home at meals, or elsewhere and at
other times.”<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></p>

<p>The value of the Table-Talk (always assuming the use
of the oldest and authentic version) is enhanced if we take
into consideration the attitude assumed with regard to it by
learned Protestant writers of earlier times. As an instance of
a certain type we may take Walch, the scholarly editor of the
important Jena edition of Luther’s works prized even to-day.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a>
He was much annoyed at the publication of the
Table-Talk, just because it furnished abundant material for
a delineation of Luther, i.e. for that very reason for which
it is esteemed by the modern historian. It was unjust, he
says, and “quite wrong to reveal what ought to have been
buried in silence, to say nothing of the opportunity thus
afforded the Papists for abuse and calumny of Luther’s
person and life.” At most&mdash;he continues in a tone in which
no present-day historian would dare to speak&mdash;mere
“selections” from the Table-Talk “which could give no
offence” ought to have been published, but thus to bring
everything ruthlessly to light was a “perversion of the
human will.” Fortunately, however, it was not possible
even so to prove much against Luther, for, “though the
sayings emanated from him originally,<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> still, they remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
mere sayings, spoken without deliberation and written down
without his knowledge or consent.”<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></p>

<p>When he made this last statement Walch was not aware
that Luther’s utterances were committed to writing in his
presence and with his full “consent and knowledge” even,
for instance, when spoken in the garden. “Strange as it
may appear to us, these men were usually busy recording
Luther’s casual words, just as though they were seated in a
lecture-hall.”<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> Once, in 1540, Catherine Bora said jestingly
to Luther, when they were at table with several industrious
students: “Doctor, don’t teach them without being paid;
they have already written down quite a lot; Lauterbach,
however, has written the most and all that is best.” To
which the Doctor replied; “I have taught and preached
gratis for thirty years, why then should I now begin to take
money for it in my old age?”<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></p>

<p>The style of the original notes of the Table-Talk in many
instances shows plainly that they were made while the
conversation was actually in progress; even the frequent
defects in the construction of the original notes, which have
now been published, prove this.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a></p>

<p>In 1844 E. Förstemann in his edition of the Table-Talk,
as against Walch, had expressed himself strongly in favour
of its correctness; he even went so far as to remark, with
all the prejudice of an editor for his own work, that these
conversations constituted the most important part of
Luther’s spiritual legacy, and that here “the current of his
thoughts flows even more limpidly than elsewhere.”<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Walter Köhler likewise, speaking of the Table-Talk edited
by Kroker, considers it a “reliable source.”<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a></p>

<p>Of Johann Aurifaber, who was the first to publish the
Table-Talk in German, at Eisleben in 1566, and through
whose edition it was most widely known, F. X. Funk said
in 1882: “As his devotion to Luther led him to make
public all the words and sayings which had come to his
knowledge, the book, in spite of its defective plan, is important
for the history of the Reformer and his time. Its
value has always been admitted, though from different
standpoints; of this its numerous editions are a proof.”<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>
The defect in the arrangement consists in the classifying
of the sayings handed down according to the different
subjects, whereby they lose their historical setting. The
large, new edition of the Table-Talk now planned, will
necessarily abandon this confusing arrangement. It has
been proved, however, that Aurifaber had a reliable version
to work on. “He most probably took for the basis of his
edition Lauterbach’s preliminary work,”<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> says Kawerau.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
This collection of Lauterbach’s has been incorporated, for
the most part, in the Halle MS. edited by Bindseil under
the title “<i>Colloquia</i>,” etc.<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> In addition to this, Aurifaber
made use of the notes by Cordatus, Schlaginhaufen, Veit
Dietrich, Mathesius and others. Kawerau draws attention
to the fact, that the coarseness to be found in the German
edition is not solely due to the compiler, as some of Luther’s
apologists had urged, but really belongs to the original
texts. Gross sayings of the sort not only gave no offence
to Aurifaber, but he delights to repeat them at great length.
Yet in certain instances he appears to have watered down
and modified his text, as one investigator has proved by a
comparison with the notes of Cordatus.<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a></p>

<h4><i>The Pith of the New Religion. Doubts on Faith.</i></h4>

<p>We shall begin by giving some practical theological
examples out of the Table-Talk which may serve further to
elucidate certain of Luther’s ideas already referred to, e.g.
those concerning temptations and their remedy, particularly
that most serious temptation of all, viz. regarding the
saving power of fiducial faith, which, so Luther thinks,
comes through our “weakness.” To this, the tender spot
and at the same time cardinal point of his teaching and
practical morality, Luther returns again and again, with a
frankness for which indeed we may be grateful. Owing to
the nature of the conversations and to his habitual loquacity
it may happen that some of the trains of thought and modes
of expression resemble those already quoted elsewhere;
this, however, is no reason for neglecting them, for they
testify anew to the ideas of which his mind was full, and also
to the state of habitual depression in which he lived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Early this morning the devil held a disputation with me on
Zwingli, and I learned that a full head is better able to wrangle
with the devil than an empty one.... Hence,” he says, “eat
and drink and live well, for bodies tempted in this way must have
plenty of food and drink; but lewdsters, and those tempted
by sensual passion, ought to fast.”<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></p>

<p>“For those who are tempted fasting is a hundred times worse
than eating and drinking.”<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a></p>

<p>“When a man is tempted, or is in the company of those who
are tempted, let him put to death Moses [i.e. the Law] and cast
stones at him; but, when he recovers, the Law must be preached
to him also; a man who is troubled must not have new trouble
heaped upon him.”<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p>“In the monastery the words ‘just and justice’ fell like a
thunderbolt upon my conscience. I was terrified when I heard
it said: ‘He is just, and He will punish.’”<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> [But now I know]:
“Our justice is a relative justice [a foreign righteousness].
Though I am not good, yet Christ is good.”<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> “Hence I say to
the devil: I, indeed, am a sinner, but Christ is righteous.”<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a></p>

<p>Many admissions reveal his altered feelings, the inconstancy
and sudden changes to which he was so prone.</p>

<p>“I do not always take pleasure in the Word. Were I always
so disposed towards the Word of God as I was formerly, then
I should indeed be happy. Even dear St. Paul had to complain
in this regard, for he bewails another law which wars in his
members. But is the Word to be considered false because it
does not happen to suit me?”<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a></p>

<p>“Unless we wrap ourselves round with this God, Who has
become both Man and Word, Satan will surely devour us.”
“Hence the aim of the Prophets and the Apostles, viz. to make
us hold fast to the Word.” “It costs God Almighty much to
manifest His power and mercy even to a few. He must slay
many kings before a few men learn to fear Him, and He must
save many a rascal and many a prostitute before even a handful
of sinners learn to believe in Him.”<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></p>

<p>“So soon as I say: ‘Yes, indeed, I am a poor sinner,’ Christ
replies, ‘But I died for you, I baptised you and I teach you
daily.’ ... Ever bear this in mind, that it is not Christ Who
affrights you, but Satan; believe this as though God Himself
were speaking.”<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p>

<p>“Is it not a curse that we should magnify our sins so greatly?
Why do we not exalt our baptism just as we exalt our inheritance?
A princely baby remains a prince even though he should
s&mdash;&mdash; in his cradle. A child does not cease being heir to his
father’s property for having soiled his father’s habiliments. If
only we could see our way to make much of our inheritance and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
patrimony before God!... Yet children call God quite simply
their Father.”<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a></p>

<p>“You are not the only man to be tempted; I also am tempted
and have bigger sins piled on my conscience than you and your
fathers. I would rather I had been a procurer or highwayman
than that I should have offered up Christ in the Mass for so
long a time.”<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">The last words may serve as an introduction to a remarkable
series of statements concerning the religious practices
of the ancient Church. As these words show, he does not
shrink from dishonouring by the most unworthy comparisons
even those acts and doctrines which, by reason of their
religious value, were dear to the whole Church of antiquity
and had been regarded by some of the purest and most
exalted souls as their only consolation in this life.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Elsewhere he says of the sacrifice of the Mass: “The blind
priestlings run to the altar like pigs to the trough”; this, “the
shame of our scarlet woman of Babylon, must be exposed.”
“I maintain that all public houses of ill-fame, strictly forbidden
by God though they be, yea, manslaughter, thieving, murder
and adultery, are not so wicked and pernicious as this abomination
of the Popish Mass.”<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

<p>He says of the Catholic preacher: “Where the undefiled
Evangel is not preached, the whoremonger is far less a sinner
than the preacher, and the brothel less wicked than the church;
that the procurer should daily make prostitutes of virgins, honest
wives and cloistered nuns, is indeed frightful to hear of; still, his
case is not so bad as that of the Popish preacher.”<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></p>

<p>The Church’s exhortation to make use of fasting as a remedy
in the struggle against sin&mdash;in which counsel she had the support
both of Holy Scripture and of immemorial experience&mdash;was thus
described by Luther: “No eating or drinking, gluttony or
drunkenness can be so bad as fasting; indeed, it would be better
to swill day and night rather than to fast for such a purpose,” so
“ludicrous and shameful in God’s sight” was such fasting.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a></p>

<p>“Confession” (as made by Catholics), Luther asserted in
1538, “is less to be condoned than any infamy.” “The devil
assails Christians with pressing temptations, most of all on
account of their confessions.”<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a></p>

<p>The life of the Saints in the Catholic Church, he says elsewhere,
consisted in “their having prayed much, fasted, laboured, taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the discipline, slept on hard pallets and worn poor clothing, a
kind of holiness which any dog or pig might practise any day.”<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a></p>

<p>He voices his abhorrence of the monastic life in figures such as
the following: “Discalced Friars are lice placed by the devil on
God Almighty’s fur coat, and Friars-preacher are the fleas of His
shirt.” “I believe the Franciscans to be possessed of the devil,
body and soul,”<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> and, reverting once again to his favourite image,
he adds elsewhere: “Neither the dens of evil women nor any
secret sins are so pernicious as those rules and vows which the
devil himself has invented.”<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">We have to proceed to the uninviting task of collecting
other sayings of Luther’s, particularly from the Table-Talk,
which are characteristic of his more than plain manner of
speaking, and to pass in review the somewhat peculiar views
held by him on matters sexual. As it is to be feared that
the delicacy of some of our readers will be offended, we may
point out that those who wish are at liberty to skip the
pages which follow and to continue from Section 7 of the
present chapter which forms the natural sequence of what
has gone before. Certainly no one would have had just
cause for complaint had one of the guests at Luther’s table
chosen to take leave when the conversation began to turn
on matters distasteful to him. The historian, however, is
obliged to remain. True to his task he may not close his
ears to what is said, however unpleasant the task of listener.
He must bear in mind that Cordatus, one of Luther’s guests,
in the Diary he wrote praises Luther’s Table-Talk as “more
precious than the oracles of Apollo.” This praise Cordatus
bestows not only on the “serious theological discourses,”
but also expressly on those sayings which were apparently
merely frivolous.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> Another pupil, Mathesius, who was also
frequently present, assures us he never heard an improper
word from Luther’s lips.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> This he writes in spite of the
fact, that one of the first anecdotes he relates, embellished
with a Latin verse from Philo, contains an unseemly jest,<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and that he himself immediately after tells how Luther on
one occasion told the people from the pulpit that: “Ein
weiter Leib und zeitiger Mist ist gut zu scheiden”; he
even mentions that Luther was carried away to express
himself yet more plainly concerning the ventral functions,
till he suddenly reined in and corrected himself. The truth
is that Mathesius was an infatuated admirer of Luther’s.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, terms descriptive of the lower functions
of the body again and again serve Luther not only to
express his anger and contempt, but as comparisons illustrative
of his ideas, whether on indifferent matters or on the
highest and most sacred topics. It is true that what he said
was improper rather than obscene, coarse rather than
lascivious. Nor, owing to the rough and uncouth character
of the age and the plainness of speech then habitual, were
his expressions, taken as a whole, so offensive to his contemporaries
as to us. Yet, that Luther should have cultivated
this particular sort of language so as to outstrip in
it all his literary contemporaries, scarcely redounds to his
credit. His readers and hearers of that day frequently
expressed their disgust, and at times his language was so
strong that even Catherine Bora was forced to cry halt.</p>

<p>As a matter of course the devil came in for the largest
share of this kind of vituperation, more particularly that
devil who was filling Luther with anxiety and trouble of
mind. The Pope and his Catholic opponents came a good
second. Luther was, however, fond of spicing in the same
way even his utterances on purely worldly matters.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“When we perceive the devil tempting us,” he says, “we can
easily overcome him by putting his pride to shame and saying to
him: ‘Leck mich im Arss,’ or ‘Scheiss in die Bruch und hengs
an den Halss.’”<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> This counsel he actually put in practice:
“On May 7, 1532, the devil was tormenting me in the afternoon,
and thoughts troubled me, such as that a thunderbolt might
kill me, so I replied to him: ‘Leck mich im Arss, I am going
to sleep, not to hold a disputation.’”<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> When the devil would
not cease urging his sins against him he had a drastic method of
effectually disposing of his importunity.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a></p>

<p>He relates in the Table-Talk, in 1536, the “artifice” by which
the parish-priest of Wittenberg, his friend Johann Bugenhagen
(Pomeranus), had put the devil to flight. It was a question of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the milk which the devil had bewitched by means of sorceresses
or witches. Luther says: “Dr. Pommer’s plan was the best,
viz. to plague them [the witches] with filth and stir it into the
milk so that everything stank. For when his [Pommer’s] cows
also lost their milk, he promptly took a vessel filled with milk,
relieved himself in it, poured out the contents and said: ‘There,
devil, eat that.’ After that he was no longer deprived of the
milk.”<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> Before this his wife and the maids had worried themselves
to death trying “to get the butter to come”&mdash;as we read
in another account of this occurrence in a version of the Table-Talk
which is more accurately dated&mdash;but all to no purpose.
“Then Pommer came up, mocked at the devil and eased himself
in the churn. Thereupon Satan ceased his tricks, for he is proud
and cannot bear to be laughed at.”<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a></p>

<p>Less formal, according to him, was the action of another
individual, who had put Satan to flight by a “<i>crepitus ventris</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

<p>Still, all temptations of the devil are profitable to us, so Luther
says, for, if we were always at peace, the devil himself “would treat
us ignominiously,”<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> for he is full of nothing but deception and
filthiness. Luther, like many of his contemporaries and later
writers, was well acquainted with the devil’s private life, and
convinced that “devil’s prostitutes: ‘<i>cum quibus Sathan coiret</i>’”
actually existed.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a></p>

<p>As the filthy details of the expulsion of the devil from the
churn are omitted in Lauterbach’s Diary, certain defenders of
Luther think they are warranted in drawing from this particular
passage the conclusion that the Table-Talk had been polluted
by “unseemly” additions in Aurifaber’s and other later versions
(above, p. 224 f.) which “must not be laid to the charge of the
Reformer.” “Not Luther in his domestic circle, but the compilers
and collectors of the much-discussed Table-Talk, Aurifaber
in particular, were rude, obscene and vulgar.” The publication
of the original documents, for instance, by Kroker in 1903, has,
however, shown the first version of the Table-Talk to be even
more intolerably coarse, and confirmed the substantial accuracy
of the text of the older German Table-Talk at present under discussion.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>
Preger, the editor of Schlaginhaufen’s notes, rightly
repudiated such evasions even in 1888, together with the alleged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
proofs urged by apologists. “We want to see Luther,” he says,
“under the actual conditions in which he moved, and in all his
own native rudeness.”<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> Kroker also pointed out that even the
first writers of the Table-Talk made use of certain signs in
their notes (e.g. × or |) in lieu of certain words employed by
Luther which they felt scrupulous about writing.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></p>

<p>“The entire lack of restraint with which Luther expresses
himself,” a Protestant writer says of the Table-Talk edited by
Kroker, “makes a remarkable impression on the reader of to-day,
more particularly when we consider that his wife and
children were among the audience.... In the Table-Talk we
meet with numerous statements, some of them far-fetched,
which are really coarse.... Although we can explain Luther’s
love of obscenities, still, this does not hinder us from deploring
his use of such and placing it to his discredit. It is true,” the
same writer proceeds, “that Luther is never lascivious or merely
frivolous.”<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> As regards the latter assertion the texts to be
adduced will afford a better opportunity of judging. That at
any rate in the instances already mentioned Luther did not
intentionally wish to excite his hearers’ passions is clear, and the
fact has been admitted even by Catholic polemics who have
really read his writings and Table-Talk.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></p>

<p class="p2">An alarming number of dirty expressions concerning the Pope
and Catholicism occur in the Table-Talk.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>
“Were the Pope to cite me to appear before him,” Luther
says, “I should not go. I should s&mdash;&mdash; upon the summons
because he is hostile to me; but were I summoned by a Council,
then I should go.”<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>

<p>Elsewhere, however, he says of the Council: “I should like,
during my lifetime, to see a Council deal with the matter, for
they would give one another a fine pummelling, and us a splendid
reason for writing against them.”<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></p>

<p>What was the origin of the Pope’s authority? “I see plainly
whence the Pope came; he is the vomit of the lazy, idle Lords
and Princes.”<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>&mdash;“Then the Pope burst upon the world with his
pestilential traditions and bound men by his carnal ordinances,
his rules and Masses, to his filthy, rotten law.”<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a></p>

<p>Such unseemly expressions occur at times in conjunction with
thoughts intended to be sublime. “I hold that God has just as
much to do in bringing things back to nothingness as He has in
creating them. This he [Luther] said, referring to human excrement.
He also said: I am astounded that the dung-hill of the
world has not reached the very sky.”<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>&mdash;“He took his baby into
his arms and perceived that it was soiling its diaper. His
remark was that the small folk by messing themselves and
by their howling and screaming earn their food and drink just
as much as we deserve heaven by our good works.”<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> He even
brings the holy name of God into conjunction with one such
customary vulgar expression. “I too have laid down rules
and sought to be master, Aber der frum Gott hat mich in sein
Arss fahren lassen und meyn Meystern ist nichts worden.”<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a></p>

<p>“There are many students here, but I do not believe there is
one who would allow himself to be anointed [by the Papists], or
open his mouth for the Pope to fill it with his filth; unless,
perhaps, Mathesius or Master Plato.”<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

<p>In his strange explanation of how far God is or is not the
author of evil, he says: Semei wished to curse and God merely
directed his curse against David (2 Kings xvi. 10). “God says:
‘Curse him and no one else.’ Just as if a man wishes to relieve
himself I cannot prevent him, but should he wish to do so on the
table here, then I should object and tell him to betake himself
to the corner.”<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a></p>

<p>“The Pope is a cuckoo who gobbles the eggs of his Church and
vomits the Cardinals.”<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a></p>

<p>It is not surprising that in Luther’s conversations on non-theological,
i.e. on secular subjects, similar and even more
offensive expressions occur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>He thinks that we “feed on the bowels of the peasants,” for
they “expel the stones” which produce the trees which produce
the fruit on which we feed.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>&mdash;He has a joke at the expense of an
unlearned man who had mistaken the Latin equivalent of the
German word “Kunst” for a common German term: “Wenn
man eynem auff die Kunst küsset so bescheist er sich.”<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a></p>

<p>Speaking of women who had the impertinence to wish for a
share in the government, he says: “The ‘Furtzlecher’ want to
rule and we suffer for it; they really should be making cheese
and milking the cows.”<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> Elsewhere he says to the preachers:
“We never seek to please anybody nor to make our mouth the
‘Arschloch’ of another.”<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

<p>“Those who now grudge the preachers of the Word their
bread will persecute us until we end by disgracing ourselves.
Then ... ‘<i>adorabunt nostra stercora</i>.’” By a natural transition
of ideas he goes on to say: “They will be glad to get rid of us,
and we shall be glad to be out of them. We are as ready to part
as ‘ein reiffer Dreck und ein weit Arssloch.’”<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>&mdash;“Rather than let
them have such a work [a conciliatory writing requested by the
inhabitants of Augsburg] I would ‘in einen Becher scheissen
und bissen,’ that they might have whereof to eat and drink.”<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a></p>

<p>“The lawyers scream [when we appropriate Church property]:
‘<i>Sunt bona ecclesiae!</i>’ ... Yes [I say], but where are we to
get our bread? ‘We leave you to see to that,’ they say. Yes,
the devil may thank them for that. We theologians have no
worse enemies than the lawyers.... We here condemn all
jurists, even the pious ones, for they do not know what ‘<i>ecclesia</i>’
means.... If a jurist wishes to dispute with you about this,
say to him: ‘Listen, my good fellow, on this subject no lawyer
should speak till he hears a sow s&mdash;&mdash;, then he must say: ‘Thank
you, Granny dear, it is long since I listened to a sermon.’”<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">After the above there is no need of giving further instances
of the kind of language with which opponents within his
fold had to put up from Luther. It will suffice to mention
the poem “<i>De merda</i>” with which he retaliated on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
satirist Lemnius for some filthy verses,<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> and the following
prediction to his Zwickau opponents: “When trouble
befalls them, whenever it may be, they will ‘in die Hosen
scheissen und ein solchen Gestanck anrichten’ that nobody
will be able to tarry in their neighbourhood.”<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a></p>

<p>It is also difficult for us to tarry any longer over these
texts, especially as in what follows we shall meet with
others of a similar character.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Not to do injustice to the general character of Luther’s
Table-Talk, we must again lay stress on the fact, that very
many of his evening conversations are of irreproachable
propriety. We may peruse many pages of the notes without
meeting anything in the least offensive, but much that is
both fine and attractive. Events of the day, history, nature,
politics or the Bible, form in turn the subject-matter of the
Table-Talk, and much of what was said was true, witty and
not seldom quite edifying.</p>

<p>Still, the fact remains that filthy talking and vulgarity
came so natural to Luther as to constitute a questionable
side to his character.</p>

<p>Even when writing seriously, and in works intended for
the general public, he seems unable to bridle his pen.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">In the book “Wider das Bapstum zu Rom vom Teuffel gestifft,”
he introduces, for instance, the following dialogue: “We have
enacted in our Decretals [say the Papists] that only the Pope
shall summon Councils and appoint to benefices. [Luther]: My
friend, is that really true? Who commanded you to decree
this? [Answer]: Be silent, you heretic, what proceeds from our
mouth must be hearkened to. [Luther]: So you say; but which
mouth do you mean? Da die Förze ausfahren? To such an
opinion you are welcome. Or that into which good Corso [wine]
is poured? Da scheiss ein Hund ein! [Answer]: Out upon
you, you shameless Luther, is it thus you talk to the Pope?
[Luther]: Out upon you rather, you rude asses and blasphemous
desperadoes, to address the Emperor and the Empire in such a
manner! How can you venture to insult and slight four such
great Councils and the four greatest Christian Emperors ‘umb
euer Förze und Drecketal [<i>sic</i>] willen?’ What reason have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
you to think yourselves anything but big, rude, senseless fools
and donkeys?”<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a></p>

<p>Before this he says in the same work, in personal abuse of Pope
Paul III.: “Dear donkey, don’t lick! Oh, dear little Pope-ass,
were you to fall and some filth escape you, how all the world
would mock at you and say: Lo, how the Pope-ass has disgraced
itself!... Oh, fiendish Father, do not be unmindful of your
great danger.”<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a></p>

<p>“Dr. Luther is a rough sort of fellow; were he to hear that,
he would rush in booted and spurred like a countryman and
say: The Pope had been thrust into the Church by all the devils
from hell.”<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> “‘As much as the sun is greater than the moon,
so does the Pope excel the Emperor.’ ... Hearken, reader; if
you forget yourself and your nether garments have to be fumigated
with incense and juniper, from such a reeking sin the
Most Holy Father would never absolve you.”<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a></p>

<p>“‘Whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven.’
‘Whatsoever’ means [according to the Catholics] all that there
is on earth, churches, bishops, emperors, kings and possibly
‘alle Förze aller Esel und sein eigen Förze auch.’ Ah, dear
brother in Christ, put it down to my credit when I speak here
and elsewhere so rudely of the cursed, noxious, ungainly monster
at Rome. Whoever knows my mind must admit that I am far,
far too lenient, and that no words or thoughts of mine could
repay his shameful and desperate abuse of the Word and Name
of Christ, our beloved Lord and Saviour.”<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“I must cease,” Luther says elsewhere in his “Wider das
Bapstum,” after speaking of a Decretal, “I cannot bear to
wallow any longer in this blasphemous, hellish, devils’ filth and
stench; let someone else read it. Whoever wants to listen to
God’s Word, let him read Holy Writ; whoever prefers to listen
to the devil’s word, let him read the Pope’s Drecket [<i>sic</i>] and
Bulls,” etc.<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">We must here consider more closely the statement, already
alluded to, made by some of Luther’s apologists. To remove
the unfavourable impression left on the mind of present-day
readers by his unbridled language an attempt has been
made to represent it as having been quite the usual thing in
Luther’s day.</p>

<p>It is true that, saving some expressions peculiar to the
Saxon peasant, such obscenity is to be met with among the
neo-Humanist writers of that age, both in Germany and
abroad. Even Catholic preachers in Germany, following
the manners of the time, show but scant consideration for
the delicacy of their hearers when speaking of sexual matters
or of the inferior functions of the human body. It is quite
impossible to set up a definite standard of what is becoming,
which shall apply equally to every age and every state of
civilisation. But if Luther’s defenders desire to exonerate
him by comparing him with others, it is clear that they are
not justified in adducing examples taken from burlesque,
popular writers, light literature, or even from certain
writings of the Humanists. The filth contained in these
works had been denounced by many a better author even
in that age. Luther, as already explained (vol. ii., p. 150 f.),
must not be judged by a profane standard, but by that which
befits a writer on religion and the spiritual life, a reformer
and founder of a new religion. The fact remains that it is
impossible to instance any popular religious writer who
ever went so far as, or even approached, Luther in his
lack of restraint in this particular. Luther, in the matter
of licentiousness of language, stands out as a giant apart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
The passages to be quoted later on marriage and the sexual
question will make this still more apparent.</p>

<p>His own contemporaries declared aloud that he stood
quite alone in the matter of coarseness and in his incessant
use of vituperation; Catholics, such as Dungersheim, and
opponents of the Catholic Church like Bullinger, testify
alike in the strongest terms to the impression made upon
them. Some of their numerous statements will be quoted
below. We may, however, remark that the severest
strictures of all came from Sir Thomas More, who, for all
his kindliness of disposition, condemned most indignantly
the filthy language of the assailant of King Henry VIII. of
England. The untranslatable passage may be read in its
Latin original in the note below.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> Caspar Schatzgeyer,
another learned opponent of Luther’s, and likewise a man
of mild temper, also rebuked Luther with great vehemence
for the ignoble and coarse tone he was wont to employ
against theological adversaries; he plainly hints that no
one within living memory had brought into the literary
arena such an arsenal of obscene language. Luther behaved
“like a conqueror, assured by the spirit that he was able to
walk upon the sea.” Spirits must, however, be tried. “The
triumphal car of the victor can only be awarded to Luther
and his followers if it be admitted that to triumph is
synonymous with befouling the face and garments of all foes
with vituperative filth (‘<i>conviciorum stercora</i>’), so that they
are forced to save themselves by flight from the intolerable
stench and dirt. Never in any literary struggle has such an
array of weapons of that sort been seen.” One could well
understand how such a man inspired fear amongst all who
valued the cleanliness of their garments. Well might he be
left to triumph with his assertion, which his adversaries
would be the last to gainsay, “that everything which is not
Gospel, must make room for the Gospel.”<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Some have gone so far as to say, that the tone of the
popular religious writers of the period, from 1450-1550, was
frequently so vulgar that there is little to choose between
them and Luther. This is an unfair and unhistorical
aspersion on a sort of literature then much read and which,
though now little known, is slowly coming to its due owing
to research. We may call to mind the long list of those in
whose writings Luther could have found not merely models
of decency and good taste&mdash;which might well have shamed
him&mdash;but also much else worthy of imitation; for instance,
Thomas à Kempis, Jacob Wimpfeling, Johann Mensing,
Johann Hoffmeister, Michael Vehe, Johann Wild, Matthias
Sittard, Caspar Schatzgeyer, Hieronymus Dungersheim,
Ulrich Krafft, Johannes Fabri, Marcus de Weida, Johann
Staupitz, and lastly Peter Canisius, who also belonged
practically to this period. Many other popular religious
authors might be enumerated, but it is impossible to instance
a single one among them who would have descended to the
level of the language employed by Luther.</p>

<p>Moreover, those secular writers of that day whose offensive
crudities have been cited in excuse of Luther, all differed
from him in one particular, viz. they did not employ these
as he did, or at least not to the same extent, as controversial
weapons. It is one thing to collect dirty stories and
to dwell on them at inordinate length in order to pander
to the depraved taste of the mob; it is quite another to
pelt an enemy with filthy abuse. Hate and fury only make
a vulgar tone more repulsive. There are phrases used by
Luther against theological adversaries which no benevolent
interpretation avails to excuse. Such was his rude answer
to the request of the Augsburgers (above, p. 233), or, again,
“I would rather advise you to drink Malvasian wine and
to believe in Christ alone, and leave the monk (who through
being a monk has denied Christ) to swill water or ‘seinen
eigenen Urin.’”<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a></p>

<p>It may occur to one to plead in justification the language
of the peasants of that day, and it must be conceded, that,
even now, in certain districts the countryman’s talk is such
as can only be appreciated in the country. The author of a
book, “Wie das Volk spricht” (1855), who made a study of
the people in certain regions not particularly remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
for culture or refinement, says quite rightly in his Preface,
that his examples are often quite unsuited “for the ears of
ladies, and those of a timorous disposition”; “the common
people don’t wear kid gloves.” This writer was dealing with
the present day, yet one might ask what indulgence an
author would find were he to draw his language from such
a source, particularly did he happen to be a theologian, a
spiritual writer or a reformer? Luther undoubtedly savours
of his time, but his expressions are too often reminiscent of
Saxon familiarity; for instance, when he vents his displeasure
in the words: “The devil has given his mother ‘eine Fliege
in den Hintern.’”<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a></p>

<p>Luther was fond of introducing indelicacies of this sort
even into theological tracts written in Latin and destined
for the use of the learned, needless to say to the huge scandal
of foreigners not accustomed to find such coarseness in the
treatment of serious subjects. Under the circumstances we
can readily understand the indignation of men like Sir
Thomas More (above, p. 237, n. 1) at the rudeness of
the German.</p>

<p>Luther’s example proved catching among his followers
and supporters. A crowd of writers became familiar with
the mention of subjects on which a discreet silence is usually
observed, and grew accustomed to use words hitherto
banished from polite society. So well were Luther’s works
known that they set the tone. His favourite pupils,
Mathesius and Aurifaber, for instance, seem scarcely aware
of the unseemliness of certain questions discussed. Sleidan,
the well-known Humanist historian, described the obscene
woodcuts published by Luther and Lucas Cranach in 1545
in mockery of the Papacy, “as calmly as though they had
been no worse than Mr. Punch’s kindly caricatures.”<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>
Luther actually told the theologians and preachers (and his
words carried even more weight with secular writers, who
were less hampered by considerations of decency) that
“those who filled the office of preacher must hold the filth
of the Pope and the bishops up to their very noses,”<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> for
the “Roman court, and the Pope who is the bishop of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
court, is the devil’s bishop, the devil himself, nay, the
excrement which the devil has ... into the Church.”<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></p>

<p>One of Luther’s most ardent defenders in the present day,
Wilhelm Walther of Rostock, exonerates Luther from any
mere imitation of the customary language of the peasants
or the monks, for, strange to say, some have seen in his tone
the influence of monasticism; he claims originality for Luther.
“Such a mode of expression,” he says, “was not in Luther’s
case the result of his peasant extraction or of his earlier life.
For, far from becoming gradually less noticeable as years
went on, it is most apparent in his old age.”<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> It is plain
that Luther’s earlier Catholic life cannot be held responsible,
nor the monastic state of celibacy, often misjudged though
it has been in certain quarters. As regards the reassertion
in him of the peasant’s son, we are at liberty to think what
we please. At any rate, we cannot but endorse what Walther
says concerning the steady growth of the disorder; in all
likelihood the applause which greeted his popular and
vigorous style reacted on Luther and tended to confirm him
in his literary habits. As years passed he grew more and
more anxious that every word should strike home, and
delighted in stamping all he wrote with the individuality of
“rude Luther.” Under the circumstances it was inevitable
that his style should suffer.</p>

<p>Walther thinks he has found the real explanation in
Luther’s “energy of character” and the depth of his “moral
feeling”; here, according to him, we have cause of his
increasingly lurid language; Luther, “in his wish to
achieve something,” and to bring “his excellent ideas”
home to the man in the street, of set purpose disregarded the
“esthetic feelings of his readers” and his own “reputation
as a writer.” Melanchthon, says Walther, “took offence
at his smutty language. Luther’s reply was to make it
smuttier still.”</p>

<p>This line of defence is remarkable enough to deserve to be
chronicled. From the historical standpoint, however, we
should bear in mind that Luther had recourse to “smuttiness”
not merely in theological and religious writings or
when desirous of producing some effect with “his excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
ideas.” The bad habit clings to him quite as much elsewhere,
and disfigures his most commonplace conversations and
casual sallies.</p>

<p>Thus the psychological root of the problem lies somewhat
deeper. We shall not be far wrong in believing, that a man
who moved habitually amidst such impure imaginations,
and gave unrestrained expression to statements of a
character so offensive, bore within himself the cause.
Luther was captain in a violent warfare on vows, religious
rules, celibacy and many other ordinances and practices of
the Church, which had formerly served as barriers against
sensuality. Consciously or unconsciously his rude nature
led him to cast off the fetters of shame which had once held
him back from what was low and vulgar. After all, language
is the sign and token of what is felt within. It was chiefly
his own renunciation of the higher standard of life which led
him to abandon politeness in speech and controversy, and,
in word and imagery, to sink into ever lower depths. Such
is most likely the correct answer to the psychological
problem presented by the steady growth of this questionable
element in his language.</p>

<p>Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (“Werke,” 7, p. 401) has
a few words, not devoid of admiration for Luther, which,
however, apply to the whole man and not merely to his
habits of speech. They may well serve as a transition to
what follows: “Luther’s merit lies in this, that he possessed
the courage of his sensuality&mdash;in those days tactfully
described as the ‘freedom of the Gospel.’”</p>

<h3>5. On Marriage and Sexuality</h3>

<p>Christianity, with its doctrine of chastity, brought into
the heathen world a new and vital element. It not only
inculcated the controlling of the sexual instinct by modesty
and the fear of God, but, in accordance with the words of our
Saviour and His Apostle, St. Paul, it represented voluntary
renunciation of marriage and a virgin life as more perfect
and meritorious in God’s sight. What appeared so entirely
foreign to the demands of nature, the Christian religion
characterised as really not only attainable, but fraught with
happiness for those who desired to follow the counsel of
Christ and who trusted in the omnipotence of His grace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
The sublime example of our Lord Himself, of His Holy
Mother, and of the disciple whom Jesus loved, also St. Paul’s
praise for virginity and the magnificent description in the
Apocalypse of the triumphal throng of virgins who follow
the Lamb, chanting a song given to them alone to sing&mdash;all
this inspired more generous souls to tread with cheerfulness
the meritorious though thorny path of continence. Besides
these, countless millions, who did not choose to live unwedded,
but were impelled by their circumstances to
embrace the married state, learnt in the school of Christianity,
with the help of God’s grace, that in matrimony too
it was possible for them to serve God cheerfully and to gain
everlasting salvation.</p>

<h4><i>The Necessity of Marriage.</i></h4>

<p>After having violated his monastic vows, Luther not
only lost a true appreciation of the celibate state when
undertaken for the love of God, but also became disposed
to exaggerate the strength of the sexual instinct in man,
to such an extent, that, according to him, extra-matrimonial
misconduct was almost unavoidable to the unmarried.
In this conviction his erroneous ideas concerning man’s
inability for doing what is good play a great part. He
lays undue stress on the alleged total depravity of man and
represents him as the helpless plaything of his evil desires
and passions, until at last it pleases God to work in him.
At the same time the strength of some of his statements on
the necessity of marriage is due to controversial interests;
to the desire to make an alluring appeal to the senses of
those bound by vows or by the ecclesiastical state, to become
unfaithful to the promises they had made to the Almighty.
Unfortunately the result too often was that Luther’s
invitation was made to serve as an excuse for a life which
did not comply even with the requirements of ordinary
morality.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“As little as it is in my power,” Luther proclaims, “that I
am not a woman, so little am I free to remain without a wife.”<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a></p>

<p>“It is a terrible thing,” he writes with glaring exaggeration
to Albert, Archbishop of Mayence, “for a man to be found without
a wife in the hour of death; at the very least he should have an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
earnest purpose of getting married. For what will he say when
God asks him: ‘I made you a man, not to stand alone but to
take a wife; where then is your wife?’”<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<p>To another cleric who fancied himself compelled to marry, he
writes in the year of his own wedding: “Your body demands
and needs it; God wills it and insists upon it.”<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a></p>

<p>“Because they [the Papists] rejected marriage [!],” he says,
“and opposed the ordinance of God and the clear testimony
and witness of Scripture, therefore they fell into fornication,
adultery, etc., to their destruction.”<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>

<p>“Just as the sun has no power to stop shining, so also is it
implanted in human nature, whether male or female, to be
fruitful. That God makes exceptions of some, as, for instance,
on the one hand of the bodily infirm and impotent, and on the
other of certain exalted natures, must be regarded in the same
light as other miracles.... Therefore it is likewise not my will
that such should marry.”<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a></p>

<p>“A man cannot dispense with a wife for this reason: The
natural instinct to beget children is as deeply implanted as that
of eating and drinking.” Hence it is that God formed the
human body in the manner He did, which Luther thereupon
proceeds to describe to his readers in detail.<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a></p>

<p>“Before marriage we are on fire and rave after a woman....
St. Jerome writes much of the temptations of the flesh. Yet
that is a trivial matter. A wife in the house will remedy that
malady. Eustochia [Eustochium] might have helped and
counselled Jerome.”<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a></p>

<p>One sentence of Luther’s, which, as it stands, scarcely does
honour to the female sex, runs as follows: “The Word and
work of God is quite clear, viz. that women were made to be
either wives or prostitutes.”<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a></p>

<p>By this statement, which so easily lends itself to misunderstanding,
Luther does not mean to put women in the alternative
of choosing either marriage or vice. In another passage of the
same writing he says distinctly, what he repeats also elsewhere:
“It is certain that He [God] does not create any woman to be a
prostitute.” Still, it is undeniable that in the above passage, in
his recommendation of marriage, he allows himself to be carried
away to the use of untimely language.&mdash;In others of the passages
cited he modifies his brutal proclamation of the force of the
sexual craving, and the inevitable necessity of marriage, by
statements to quite another effect, though these are scarcely
noticeable amid the wealth of words which he expends in favour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
of man’s sensual nature; for instance, he speaks of the “holy
virgins,” who “live in the flesh as though not of the flesh, thanks
to God’s sublime grace.”<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> “The grace of chastity”<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> was, he
admits, sometimes bestowed by God, yet he speaks of the person
who possesses it as a “prodigy of God’s own”;<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> such a one it is
hard to find, for such a man is no “natural man.”<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> Such
extravagant stress laid on the fewness of these exceptions might,
however, be refuted from his own words; for instance, he urges
a woman whose husband is ill to do her best with the ordinary
grace of God bestowed on her as on all others, and endure with
patience the absence of marital intercourse. “God is much too
just to rob you of your husband by sickness in this way without
on the other hand taking away the wantonness of the flesh, if
you on your part tend the sick man faithfully.”<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a></p>

<p>That for most men it is more advisable to marry than to
practise continence had never been questioned for a moment by
Catholics, and if Luther had been speaking merely to the majority
of mankind, as some have alleged he was, his very opponents
could not but have applauded him. It is, however, as impossible
to credit him with so moderate a recommendation as it is to
defend another theory put forward by Protestants, viz. that
his sole intention was to point out “that the man in whom
the sexual instinct is at work cannot help being sensible of it.”</p>

<p>His real view, as so frequently described by himself, is
linked up to some extent with his own personal experiences
after he had abandoned the monastic life. It can scarcely be by
mere chance that a number of passages belonging here synchronise
with his stay at the Wartburg, and that his admission
to his friend Melanchthon (“I burn in the flames of my carnal
desires ... ‘<i>ferveo carne, libidine</i>’”)<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> should also date from
this time.</p>

<p>In an exposition often quoted from his course of sermons on
Exodus, Luther describes with great exaggeration the violence
and irresistibility of the carnal instinct in man, in order to conclude
as usual that ecclesiastical celibacy is an abomination.
His strange words, which might so readily be misunderstood,
call for closer consideration than is usually accorded them; they,
too, furnished a pretext for certain far-fetched charges against
Luther.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>With the Sixth Commandment, says Luther, God “scolds,
mocks and derides us”; this Commandment shows that the
world is full of “adulterers and adulteresses,” all are “whore-mongers”;
on account of our lusts and sensuality God accounted
us as such and so gave us the Sixth Commandment; to a man
of good conduct it would surely be an insult to say: “My good
fellow, see you keep your plighted troth!” God, however,
wished to show us “what we really are.” “Though we may
not be so openly before the world [i.e. adulterers and whore-mongers],
yet we are so at heart, and, had we opportunity, time
and occasion, we should all commit adultery. It is implanted
in all men, and no one is exempt ... we brought it with us
from our mother’s womb.”<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> Luther does not here wish to
represent adultery as a universal and almost inevitable vice, or
to minimise its sinfulness. Here, as so often elsewhere, he
perceives he has gone too far and thereupon proceeds to explain
his real meaning. “I do not say that we are so in very deed,
but that such is our inclination, and it is the heart that God
searches.” Luther is quite willing to admit: “There are certainly
many who do not commit fornication, but lead quite a good life”;
“this is due either to God’s grace, or to fear of Master Hans”
(the hangman). “Our reason tells us that fornication, adultery
and other sins are wrong.... All these laws are decreed by
nature itself,” just like the Commandment not to commit murder.<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a>
“But we are so mad,” “when once our passions are aroused,
that we forget everything.” Hence we cannot but believe, that
“even though our monks vowed chastity twice over,” they were
adulterers in God’s sight. The conclusion he arrives at is:
“Such being our nature, God forbids no one to take a wife.”</p>

<p>The whole passage is only another instance of Luther’s desire
to magnify the consequences of original sin without making due
allowance for the remedies provided by Christianity, the sacraments
in particular. It is also in keeping with his usual method
of clothing his attack on Catholicism in the most bitter and
repulsive language, a method which gradually became a second
nature to him.</p></div>

<p class="p1">In insisting on the necessity of marriage, Luther does not
stop to consider that the Church of antiquity, for all her
esteem for matrimony, was ever careful to see that the duties
and interests of the individual, of the State and of the
Church were respected, and not endangered by hasty
marriages. Luther himself was not hampered by considerations
of that sort, whether in the case of priests, monks or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
laymen. The unmarried state revolted him to such a degree,
that he declares nothing offended his “ears more than the
words nun, monk and priest,” and that he looked on marriage
as “a Paradise, even though the married pair lived in
abject poverty.”<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> A couple, who on account of their circumstances
should hesitate to marry, he reproaches with a
“pitiful want of faith.” “A boy not later than the age of
twenty, and a girl when she is from fifteen to eighteen
years of age [ought to marry]. Then they are still healthy
and sound, and they can leave it to God to see that their
children are provided for.”<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a></p>

<p>If we are to take him at his word, then a cleric ought to
marry merely to defy the Pope. “For, even though he may
have the gift so as to be able to live chastely without a wife,
yet he ought to marry in defiance of the Pope, who insists
so much on celibacy.”<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a></p>

<h4><i>The “Miracle” of Voluntary and Chaste Celibacy.</i></h4>

<p>Of the celibate and continent life Luther had declared
(above, p. 242-3) that practically only a miracle could render
it possible.<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> If we compare his statements on virginity, we
shall readily see how different elements were warring within
him. On the one hand he is anxious to uphold the plain
words of Scripture, which place voluntary virginity above
marriage. On the other, his conception of the great and,
without grace, irresistible power of concupiscence draws
him in the opposite direction. Moreover, man, being devoid
of free will, and incapable of choosing of his own accord the
higher path, in order not to fall a prey to his lusts, must
resolutely embrace the married state intended by God
for the generality of men. Then, again, we must not discount
the change his views underwent after his marriage with
a nun.</p>

<p>In view of the “malady” of “the common flesh,” he
says of the man who pledges himself to voluntary chastity,
that “on account of this malady, marriage is necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
him and it is not in his power to do without it; for his flesh
rages, burns and tends to be fruitful as much as that of any
other man, and he must have recourse to marriage as the
necessary remedy. Such passion of the flesh God permits
for the sake of marriage and for that of the progeny.”<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>&mdash;And
yet, according to another passage in Luther’s writings,
even marriage is no remedy for concupiscence: “Sensual
passion (‘<i>libido</i>’) cannot be cured by any remedy, not even
marriage, which God has provided as a medicine for weak
nature. For the majority of married people are adulterers,
and each says to the other in the words of the poet: ‘Neither
with nor without you can I live.’”<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> “Experience teaches
us, that, in the case of many, even marriage is not a sufficient
remedy; otherwise there would be no adultery or fornication,
whereas, alas, they are only too frequent.”<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a></p>

<p>It is merely a seeming contradiction to his words on the
miraculous nature of virginity when Luther says on one
occasion: “<i>Many</i> are to be met with who have this gift;
I also had it, though with many evil thoughts and dreams,”<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a>
for possibly, owing to his reference to himself, modesty led
him here to represent this rare and miraculous gift as less
unusual. Here he speaks of “many,” but usually of the
“few.” “We find so few who possess God’s gift of
chastity.”<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> “They are rare,” he says in his sermon on
conjugal life, “and among a thousand there is scarcely one
to be found, for they are God’s own wonder-works; no man
may venture to aspire to this unless God calls him in a
special manner.”<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a></p>

<p>Luther acknowledges that those in whom God works this
“miracle”&mdash;who, while remaining unmarried, do not
succumb to the deadly assaults of concupiscence&mdash;were to
be esteemed fortunate on account of the happiness of the
celibate state. It would be mere one-sidedness to dwell
solely upon Luther’s doctrine of the necessity and worth
of marriage and not to consider the numerous passages in
which he speaks in praise of voluntary and chaste celibacy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">He says in the sermon on conjugal life: “No state of life is
to be regarded as more pleasing in the sight of God than the
married state. The state of chastity is certainly better on earth
as having less of care and trouble, not in itself, but because a
man can give himself to preaching and the Word of God [1 Cor.
vii. 34].... In itself it is far less exalted.”<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> In the following
year, 1523, in his exposition of 1 Corinthians, chapter vii., St.
Paul’s declaration leads him to extol virginity: “Whoever has
grace to remain chaste, let him do so and abstain from marriage
and not take upon himself such trouble unless need enforce it, as
St. Paul here counsels truly; for it is a great and noble freedom
to be unmarried and saves one from much disquietude, vexation
and trouble.”<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> He even goes so far as to say: “It is a sweet,
joyous and splendid gift, for him to whom it is given, to be chaste
cheerfully and willingly,”<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> and for this reason in particular “is it
a fine thing,” because it enables us the better to serve the
“Christian Churches, the Evangel and the preaching of the
Word”; this is the case “when you refrain from taking a wife
so as to be at peace and to be of service to the Kingdom of
Heaven.” The preacher, he explains, for instance, was not
expected to ply a trade, for which reason also he received a
stipend for preaching. “Hence, whoever wishes to serve the
Churches and to enjoy greater quiet, would do well to remain
without a wife, for then he would have neither wife nor child to
support.”<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> “Whoever has the gift of being able to live without
a wife, is an angel on earth and leads a peaceful life.”<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a></p>

<p>In this way Luther comes practically to excuse, nay, even to
eulogise, clerical celibacy; elsewhere we again find similar ideas
put forward.</p>

<p>In his Latin exposition of Psalm cxxviii. he says: “There
must be freedom either to remain single or to marry. Who would
force the man who has no need to marry to do so? Whoever is
among those who are able ‘to receive this word,’ let him remain
unmarried and glory in the Lord.... They who can do without
marrying do well (<i>recte faciunt</i>) to abstain from it and not to
burden themselves with the troubles it brings.”<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> And again:
“Whoever is set free by such a grace [a ‘special and exalted
grace of God’], let him thank God and obey it.”<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> For “if we
contrast the married state with virginity, chastity is undoubtedly
a nobler gift than marriage, but, still, marriage is as much God’s
gift&mdash;so St. Paul tells us&mdash;as chastity.”<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> Compared with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
chastity of marriage, “virgin chastity is more excellent (<i>virginalis
castitas excellentior est</i>).”<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> “Celibacy is a gift of God
and we commend both this and the married state in their measure
and order. We do not extol marriage as though we should slight
or repudiate celibacy.”<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a></p>

<p>Usually Luther represents virginity as not indeed superior
but quite equal to the married state: “To be a virgin or a
spouse is a different gift; both are equally well pleasing to God.”<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a>
As we might expect, we find the warmest appreciation of celibacy
expressed before Luther himself began to think of marriage,
whereas, subsequent to 1525, his strictures on celibacy become
more frequent. In 1518, without any restriction, he has it
that virginity is held to be the highest ornament and “an
incomparable jewel”; in the case of religious, chastity was all
the more precious because “they had of their own free will given
themselves to the Lord.”<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> In the following year, comparing the
married state with virginity, he says that “virginity is better,”
when bestowed by the grace of God.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">“The breach with the past caused by his marriage,” says
M. Rade, was “greater and more serious” than any change
effected in later years in matrimonial relationship.<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> By
his advocacy of marriage, as against celibacy and his glorification
of family life, Luther brought about “a reversal of all
accepted standards.”<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> Rade, not without sarcasm, remarks:
“There is something humorous in the way in which Luther
in his exposition of 1 Corinthians vii., which we have
repeatedly had occasion to quote, after praising virginity
ever passes on to the praise of the married state.”<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> It is
quite true that his interpretation seems forced, when he
makes St. Paul, in this passage, extol continency, not on
account of its “merit and value in God’s sight,” but merely
for the “tranquillity and comfort it insures in this life.”<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a>
To Luther it is of much greater interest, that St. Paul should
be “so outspoken in his praise of the married state and
should allude to it as a Divine gift.” He at once proceeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
to prove from this, that “the married state is the holiest
state of all, and that certain states had been falsely termed
‘religious’ and others ‘secular’; for the reverse ought to
be the case, the married state being truly religious and
spiritual.”<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a></p>

<p>Luther’s animus against celibacy became manifest everywhere.
He refused to give sufficient weight to the Bible
passages, to the self-sacrifice so pleasing to God involved
in the unmarried state, or to its merits for time and for
eternity. It is this animus which leads him into exaggeration
when he speaks of the necessity of marriage for all men,
and to utter words which contradict what he himself had
said in praise of celibacy.</p>

<p>He paints in truly revolting colours the moral abominations
of the Papacy, exaggerating in unmeasured terms the
notorious disorders which had arisen from the infringement
of clerical celibacy. His controversial writings contain
disgusting and detailed descriptions of the crimes committed
against morality in the party of his opponents; the
repulsive tone is only rivalled by his prejudice and
want of discrimination which lead him to believe every
false report or stupid tale redounding to the discredit of
Catholicism.</p>

<p>His conception of the rise of clerical celibacy is inclined
to be hazy: “The celibacy of the clergy commenced in the
time of Cyprian.” Elsewhere he says that it began “in the
time of Bishop Ulrich, not more than five hundred years
ago.”<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a></p>

<p>He assures us that “St. Ambrose and others did not believe
that they were men.”<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> “The infamous superstition [of
celibacy] gave rise to, and promoted, horrible sins such as
fornication, adultery, incest ... also strange apparitions
and visions.... What else could be expected of monks,
idle and over-fed pigs as they were, than that they should
have such fancies?”<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>&mdash;In the Pope’s Ten Commandments
there was, so he said, a sixth which ran: “Thou shalt not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
be unchaste, but force them to be so” (by means of vows
and celibacy), and a ninth: “Thou shalt not covet thy
neighbour’s wife, but say, it is no sin.”<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></p>

<p>“Were all those living under the Papacy kneaded
together, not one would be found who had remained chaste
up to his fortieth year. Yet they talk much of virginity and
find fault with all the world while they themselves are up
to their ears in filth.”<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a>&mdash;“It pleases me to see the Saints
sticking in the mud just like us. But it is true that God
allows nature to remain, together with the spirit and with
grace.”<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Luther’s Loosening of the Marriage Tie.</i></h4>

<p>Luther, advocate and promoter of marriage though he
was, himself did much to undermine its foundations, which
must necessarily rest on its indissolubility and sanctity as
ordained by Christ. In the six following cases which he
enumerates he professes to find sufficient grounds for
dissolving the marriage tie, overstepping in the most
autocratic fashion the limits of what is lawful to the manifest
detriment of matrimony.</p>

<p>He declares, first, that if one or other of the married
parties should be convicted of obstinately refusing “to
render the conjugal due, or to remain with the other,” then
“the marriage was annulled”; the husband might then
say: “If you are unwilling, some other will consent; if
the wife refuse, then let the maid come”; he had the full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
right to take an Esther and dismiss Vasthi, as King Assuerus
had done (Esther ii. 17).<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> To the remonstrances of his wife
he would be justified in replying: “Go, you prostitute, go
to the devil if you please”;<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> the injured party was at liberty
to contract a fresh union, though only with the sanction of
the authorities or of the congregation, while the offending
party incurred the penalty of the law and might or might
not be permitted to marry again.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a></p>

<p>The words: “If you won’t ... then let the maid come”
were destined to become famous. Not Catholics only, but
Protestants too, found in them a stone of offence. As they
stand they give sufficient ground for scandal. Was it, however,
Luther’s intention thereby to sanction relations with
the maid outside the marriage bond? In fairness the
question must be answered in the negative. Both before
and after the critical passage the text speaks merely of the
dissolution of the marriage and the contracting of another
union; apart from this, as is clear from other passages,
Luther never sanctioned sexual commerce outside matrimony.
Thus, strictly speaking, according to him, the
husband would only have the right to threaten the obstinate
wife to put her away and contract a fresh union with the
maid. At the same time the allusion to the maid was
unfortunate, as it naturally suggested something different
from marriage. In all probability it was the writer’s
inveterate habit of clothing his thought in the most drastic
language at his command that here led him astray. It
may be that the sentence “Then let the maid come”
belonged to a rude proverb which Luther used without
fully adverting to its actual meaning, but it has yet to be
proved that such a proverb existed before Luther’s day;
at any rate, examples can be quoted of the words having
been used subsequently as a proverb, on the strength of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
example.<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a>&mdash;It was on this, the first ground for the dissolution
of marriage, that Luther based his decision in 1543,
when one of the Professors turned preacher and his wife
refused to follow him to his post at Frankfort-on-the-Oder,
saying that “she wasn’t going to have a parson.” Luther
then wrote: “I should at once leave her and marry
another,” should she categorically refuse compliance; in
reality the authorities ought to coerce her, but unfortunately
no authority “with ‘<i>executio</i>’ existed, having power over
the ‘<i>ministerium</i>.’”<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a></p>

<p>Secondly, according to Luther, the adultery of one party
justified the other in assuming that the “guilty party
was already <i>ipso facto</i> divorced”; “he can then act as
though his spouse had died,” i.e. marry again, though
Christian considerations intimate that he should wait at
least six months.<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a></p>

<p>Thirdly, if one party “will not suffer the other to live in
a Christian manner,” then the other, finding a separation
from bed and board of no avail, has the right to “make a
change,” i.e. to contract another union. “But how,” he
asks, “if this new spouse should turn out ill and try to force
the other to live like a heathen, or in an unchristian
manner, or should even run away; what then, supposing
this thing went on three, four or even ten times?” Luther’s
answer to the conundrum is the same as before: “We
cannot gag St. Paul, and therefore we cannot prevent those
who desire to do so from making use of the freedom he
allows.” Luther’s conviction was that the well-known
passage in 1 Corinthians vii. 15 sanctioned this dangerous
doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a></p>

<p>Fourthly, if subsequent to the marriage contract one
party should prove to be physically unfit for matrimony,
then, according to Luther, the marriage might be regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
as dissolved without any ecclesiastical suit solely by “conscience
and experience.” He would in that case advise, he
says, that the woman, with the consent of the man, should
enter into carnal relations with someone else, for instance,
with her partner’s brother, for her husband would really be
no husband at all, but merely a sort of bachelor life-partner;
this marriage might, however, be kept secret and the
children be regarded as those of the putative father.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> Even
where it was not a question of impotence but of leprosy
Luther decided in much the same way, without a word of
reference to any ecclesiastical or legal suit: should the
healthy party “be unable or unwilling to provide for the
household” without a fresh marriage, and should the sick
party “consent willingly to a separation,” then the latter
was simply to be looked upon as dead, the other party being
free to re-marry.<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a></p>

<p>To these grounds of separation Luther, however, added
a fifth. He declared, on the strength of certain, biblical
passages, that marriage with the widow of a brother&mdash;for
which, on showing sufficient grounds, it was possible to
obtain a dispensation in the Catholic Church&mdash;was invalid
under all circumstances, and that therefore any person
married on the strength of such a dispensation might
conclude a fresh union. At first, in 1531, such was not his
opinion, and he declared quite valid the marriage of Henry
VIII. with his sister-in-law Catherine of Aragon, which
was the outcome of such a dispensation; later on, however,
in 1536, on ostensibly biblical grounds he discarded the
Catholic view.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>His views, not here alone but elsewhere, on matrimonial
questions, were founded on an altogether peculiar
interpretation of Scripture; he sought in Scripture for
the proofs he wished to find, interpreting the Sacred
Text in utter disregard of the teaching of its best authorised
exponents and the traditions of the Church. The consequences
of such arbitrary exegetical study he himself
described characteristically enough. Speaking of Carlstadt,
who, like him, was disposed to lay great stress on Old-Testament
examples and referring to one of his matrimonial
decisions which he was not disposed to accept,
Luther exclaims: “Let him [Carlstadt] do as he pleases;
soon we shall have him introducing circumcision at Orlamünde
and making Mosaists of them all.”<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a></p>

<p>Yet he was perfectly aware of the danger of thus loosening
the marriage tie. He feared that fresh grounds for severing
the same would be invented day by day.<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> On one occasion
he exclaims, as though to stifle his rising scruples, that it
was clear that all God cares for is “faith and confession....
It does not matter to Him whether you dismiss your wife
and break your word. For what is it to Him whether you
do so or not? But because you owe a duty to your neighbour,”
for this reason only, i.e. on account of the rights of
others, it is wrong.<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> These strange words, which have often
been misunderstood and quoted against Luther by polemics,
were naturally not intended to question the existence of the
marriage tie, but they are dangerous in so far as they do not
make sufficient account of the nature of the commandment
and the sin of its breach.</p>

<p>Most momentous of all, however, was the sixth plea in
favour of divorce, an extension of those already mentioned.
Not merely the apostasy of one party or his refusal to live
with the Christian party, justified the other to contract a
fresh union, but even should he separate, or go off, “for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
any reason whatever, for instance, through anger or dislike.”
Should “husband or wife desert the other in this way, then
Paul’s teaching [!] was to be extended so far ... that the
guilty party be given the alternative either to be reconciled
or to lose his spouse, the innocent party being now free
and at liberty to marry again in the event of a refusal.
It is unchristian and heathenish for one party to desert the
other out of anger or dislike, and not to be ready patiently
to bear good and ill, bitter and sweet with his spouse, as his
duty is, hence such a one is in reality a heathen and no
Christian.”<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a></p>

<p>Thus did Luther write, probably little dreaming of the
incalculable confusion he was provoking in the social conditions
of Christendom by such lax utterances. Yet he was
perfectly acquainted with the laws to the contrary. He declaims
against “the iniquitous legislation of the Pope, who,
in direct contravention of this text of St. Paul’s (1 Cor. vii.
15), commands and compels such a one, under pain of the
loss of his soul, not to re-marry, but to await either the
return of the deserter or his death,” thus “needlessly driving
the innocent party into the danger of unchastity.” He also
faces, quite unconcernedly, the difficulty which might arise
should the deserter change his mind and turn up again
after his spouse had contracted a new marriage. “He is
simply to be disregarded and discarded ... and serve him
right for his desertion. As matters now are the Pope simply
leaves the door open for runaways.”<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a></p>

<p>The new matrimonial legislator refuses to see that he is
paving the way for the complete rupture of the marriage tie.
If the mere fact of one party proving disinclined to continue
in the matrimonial state and betaking himself elsewhere is
sufficient to dissolve a marriage, then every barrier falls,
and, to use Luther’s own words of the Pope a little
further, “it is no wonder that the world is filled with
broken pledges and forsaken spouses, nay, with adultery
which is just what the devil is aiming at by [such a]
law.”<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, Luther, in his reforms, attacks those
matrimonial impediments which, from the earliest Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
times, had always been held to invalidate marriages. The
marriage of a Christian with a heathen or a Jew he thinks
perfectly valid, though, as was to be expected, he does not
regard it with a friendly eye. We are not to trouble at all
about the Pope’s pronouncements concerning invalidity:
“Just as I may eat and drink, sleep and walk, write and
treat, talk and work with a pagan or a Jew, a Turk or a
heretic, so also can I contract a marriage with him. Therefore
pay no heed to the fool-laws forbidding this.” “A
heathen is just as much a man or woman as St. Peter,
St. Paul or St. Lucy.”<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a></p>

<p>M. Rade, the Protestant theologian quoted above, considers
that on the question of divorce Luther took up “quite
a different attitude,” and “opened up new prospects” altogether
at variance with those of the past.<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> By his means was
brought about a “complete reversal of public opinion on
the externals of sexual life”; in this connection to speak
of original sin was in reality mere “inward contradiction.”
Such were, according to him, the results of the “Christian
freedom” proclaimed by Luther.<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a></p>

<p>August Bebel, in his book “Die Frau und der Sozialismus,”
says of Luther: “He put forward, regarding matrimony,
views of the most radical character.”<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> “In advocating
liberty with regard to marriage, what he had in mind was
the civil marriage such as modern German legislation
sanctions, together with freedom to trade and to move from
place to place.”<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> “In the struggle which it now wages with
clericalism social democracy has the fullest right to appeal
to Luther, whose position in matrimonial matters was
entirely unprejudiced. Luther and the reformers even
went further in the marriage question, out of purely utilitarian
motives and from a desire to please the rulers concerned,
whose powerful support and lasting favour they
were desirous of securing and retaining. Landgrave Philip I.
of Hesse, who was well disposed towards the reformation,”
etc. etc.<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Polygamy.</i></h4>

<p>Sanctity of marriage in the Christian mind involves
monogamy. The very word polygamy implies a reproach.
Luther’s own feelings at the commencement revolted
against the conclusions which, as early as 1520, he had felt
tempted to draw from the Bible against monogamy, for
instance, from the example of the Old Testament Patriarchs,
such as Abraham, whom Luther speaks of as “a true,
indeed a perfect Christian.”<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> It was not long, however,
before he began to incline to the view that the example of
Abraham and the Patriarchs did, as a matter of fact, make
polygamy permissible to Christians.</p>

<p>In September, 1523, in his exposition on Genesis xvi., he
said without the slightest hesitation: “We must take his
life [Abraham’s] as an example to be followed, provided it
be carried out in the like faith”; of course, it was possible
to object, that this permission of having several wives had
been abrogated by the Gospel; but circumcision and the
sacrifice of the Paschal Lamb had also been abrogated, and
yet they “are not sins, but quite optional, i.e. neither sinful
nor praiseworthy.... The same must hold good of other
examples of the Patriarchs, namely, if they had many
wives, viz. that this also is optional.”<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a></p>

<p>In 1523 he advanced the following: “A man is not
absolutely forbidden to have more than one wife; I could
not prevent it, but certainly I should not counsel it.” He
continues in this passage: “Yet I would not raise the
question but only say, that, should it come before the
sheriff, it would be right to answer that we do not reject the
example of the Patriarchs, as though they were not right in
doing what they did, as the Manicheans say.”<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a></p>

<p>The sermons where these words occur were published at
Wittenberg in 1527 and at once scattered broadcast in
several editions. We shall have to tell later how the Landgrave
Philip of Hesse expressly cited on his own behalf
the passage we have quoted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, i.e. previous to the printing of his
sermons on Genesis, Luther had declared, in a memorandum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
of January 27, 1524, addressed to Brück, the electoral
Chancellor, regarding a case in point, viz. that of an Orlamünde
man who wished to have two wives, that he was
“unable to forbid it”; it “was not contrary to Holy
Scripture”; yet, on account of the scandal and for the
sake of decorum, which at times demanded the omission
even of what was lawful, he was anxious not to be the first
to introduce amongst Christians “such an example, which
was not at all becoming”; should, however, the man, with
the assistance of spiritual advisers, be able to form a “firm
conscience by means of the Word,” then the “matter might
well be left to take its course.”<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> This memorandum, too,
also came to the knowledge of Landgrave Philip of Hesse.<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a></p>

<p>Subsequently Luther remained faithful to the standpoint
that polygamy was not forbidden but optional; this is
proved by his Latin Theses of 1528,<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> by his letter, on
September 3, 1531,<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> addressed to Robert Barnes for Henry
VIII. and in particular by his famous declaration of 1539
to Philip of Hesse, sanctioning his bigamy.</p>

<p>His defenders have taken an unfinished treatise which he
commenced in the spring of 1542<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> as indicating, if not a
retractation, at least a certain hesitation on his part; yet
even here he shows no sign of embracing the opposite view;
in principle he held fast to polygamy and merely restricts it
to the domain of conscience. The explanation of the writing
must be sought for in the difficulties arising out of the bigamy
of Landgrave Philip. Owing to Philip’s representations
Luther left the treatise unfinished, but on this occasion he
expressly admitted to the Prince, that there were “four
good reasons” to justify his bigamy.<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a></p>

<p>Needless to say, views such as these brought Luther into
conflict with the whole of the past.</p>

<p>Augustine, like the other Fathers, had declared that
polygamy was “expressly forbidden” in the New Testament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
as a “crime” (“<i>crimen</i>”).<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> Peter Lombard, Thomas
Aquinas and Bonaventure speak in similar terms in the
name of the scholasticism of the Middle Ages. Peter
Paludanus, the so-called “<i>Doctor egregius</i>” († 1342),
repeated in his work on the Sentences, that: “Under the
Gospel-dispensation it never had been and never would be
permitted.”<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a></p>

<p>It is, however, objected that Cardinal Cajetan, the famous
theologian and a contemporary of Luther, had described
polygamy as allowable in principle, and that Luther merely
followed in his footsteps. But Cajetan does not deny that
the prohibition pronounced by the Church stands, he merely
deals in scholastic fashion with the questions whether
polygamy is a contravention of the natural law, and whether
it is expressly interdicted in Holy Scripture. True enough,
however, he answers both questions in the negative.<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> In
the first everything of course depends on the view taken with
regard to the patriarchs and the Old Testament exceptions;
the grounds for these exceptions (for such they undoubtedly
were) have been variously stated by theologians. In the
second, i.e. in the matter of Holy Scripture, Cajetan erred.
His views on this subject have never been copied and,
indeed, a protest was at once raised by Catharinus, who
appealed to the whole body of theologians as teaching that,
particularly since the preaching of the Gospel, there was no
doubt as to the biblical prohibition.<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a></p>

<p>Thus, in spite of what some Protestants have said, it was
not by keeping too close to the mediæval doctrine of matrimony,
that Luther reached his theory of polygamy.</p>

<p>It is more likely that he arrived at it owing to his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
arbitrary and materialistic ideas on marriage. It was
certainly not the Catholic Church which showed him the
way; as she had safeguarded the sanctity of marriage, so
also she protected its monogamous character and its indissolubility.
In Luther’s own day the Papacy proved by
its final pronouncement against the adultery of Henry VIII.
of England, that she preferred to lose that country to the
Church rather than sanction the dissolving of a rightful
marriage (vol. iv., xxi. 1).</p>

<h4><i>Toleration for Concubinage? Matrimony no Sacrament.</i></h4>

<p>In exceptional cases Luther permitted those bound to
clerical celibacy, on account of “the great distress of
conscience,” to contract “secret marriages”; he even
expressly recommended them to do so.<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> These unions,
according to both Canon and Civil law, amounted to mere
concubinage. Luther admits that he had advised “certain
parish priests, living under the jurisdiction of Duke George
or the bishops,” to “marry their cook secretly.”<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a></p>

<p>At the same time, in this same letter written in 1540,
he explains that he is not prepared to “defend all he had
said or done years ago, particularly at the commencement.”
Everything, however, remained in print and was made use
of not only by those to whom it was actually addressed,
but by many others also; for instance, his outrageous letter
to the Knights of the Teutonic Order who were bound by
vow to the celibate state. Any of them who had a secret,
illicit connection, and “whoever found it impossible to live
chastely,” he there says, “was not to despair in his weakness
and sin, nor wait for any Conciliar permission, for I
would rather overlook it, and commit to the mercy of God
the man who all his life has kept a pair of prostitutes, than
the man who takes a wife in compliance with the decrees of
such Councils.” “How much less a sinner do you think
him to be, and nearer to the grace of God, who keeps a
prostitute, than the man who takes a wife in that way?”<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a></p>

<p>Of the Prince-Abbots, who, on account of the position they
occupied in the Empire, were unable to marry so long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
they remained in the monastery, he likewise wrote: “I
would prefer to advise such a one to take a wife secretly
and to continue as stated above [i.e. remain in office],
seeing that among the Papists it is neither shameful nor
wrong to keep women, until God the Lord shall send otherwise
as He will shortly do, for it is impossible for things to
remain much longer as they are. In this wise the Abbot
would be safe and provided for.”<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a></p>

<p>Here again we see how Luther’s interest in promoting
apostasy from Rome worked hand in hand with the lax
conception he had been led to form of marriage.</p>

<p>Of any sacrament of matrimony he refused to hear. To
him marriage was really a secular matter, however much
he might describe it as of Divine institution: “Know, that
marriage is an outward, material thing like any other
secular business.”<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> “Marriage and all that appertains to it
is a temporal thing and does not concern the Church at all,
except in so far as it affects the conscience.”<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> “Marriage
questions do not concern the clergy or the preachers, but the
authorities; theirs it is to decide on them”; this, the
heading of one of the chapters of the German Table-Talk,
rightly describes its contents.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a></p>

<p>In Luther’s denial of the sacramental character of
matrimony lies the key to the arbitrary manner in which,
as shown by the above, he handled the old ecclesiastical
marriage law. It was his ruling ideas on faith and justification
which had led him to deny that it was a sacrament.
The sacraments, in accordance with this view, have no
other object or effect than to kindle in man, by means of
the external sign, that faith which brings justification. Now
marriage, to his mind, was of no avail to strengthen or
inspire such faith. As early as 1519 he bewails the lack in
matrimony of that Divine promise which sets faith at work
(“<i>quae fidem exerceat</i>”),<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> and in his Theses of February 13,
1520, he already shows his disposition to question its right
to be termed a sacrament.<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> In his work “On the Babylonish
Captivity” of the same year he bluntly denies its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
sacramental character, urging that the Bible was silent on
the subject, that matrimony held out no promise of salvation
to be accepted in faith, and finally that it was in no
way specifically Christian, since it had already existed
among the heathen.<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> He ignores all that the Fathers had
taught regarding marriage as a sacrament, with special
reference to the passage in Ephesians v. 31 ff., and likewise
the ancient tradition of the Church as retained even by the
Eastern sects separated from Rome since the fifth century.</p>

<p>In advocating matrimony, instead of appealing to it as
a sacrament, he lays stress on its use as a remedy provided
by God against concupiscence, and on its being the foundation
of that family life which is so pleasing to God. Incidentally
he also points out that it is a sign of the union of Christ
with the congregation.<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a></p>

<p>Luther did not, as has been falsely stated, raise marriage
to a higher dignity than it possessed in the Middle Ages.
No more unjustifiable accusation has been brought against
Catholic ages than that marriage did not then come in for
its due share of recognition, that it was slighted and even
regarded as sinful. Elsewhere we show that the writings
dating from the close of the Middle Ages, particularly
German sermonaries and matrimonial handbooks, are a
direct refutation of these charges.<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a></p>

<h4><i>Luther on Matters Sexual.</i></h4>

<p>Examples already cited have shown that, in speaking of
sexual questions and of matters connected with marriage,
Luther could adopt a tone calculated to make even the
plainest of plain speakers wince. It is our present duty to
examine more carefully this quality in the light of some
quotations. Let the reader, if he chooses, look up the
sermon of 1522, “On Conjugal Life,” and turn to pages 58,
59, 61, 72, 76, 83, 84; or to pages 34, 35, 139, 143, 144, 146,
152, etc., of his Exposition of Corinthians.<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> We are compelled
to ask: How many theological or spiritual writers,
in sermons intended for the masses, or in vernacular works,
ever ventured to discuss sexual matters with the nakedness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
that Luther displays in his writing “Wyder den falsch
genantten geystlichen Standt des Bapst und der Bischoffen”
(1522), in which through several pages Luther compares,
on account of its celibacy, the Papacy with the abominable
Roman god Priapus.<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> In this and like descriptions he lays
himself open to the very charge which he brings against the
clergy: “They seduce the ignorant masses and drag them
down into the depths of unchastity.”<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> He thus compares
Popery to this, the most obscene form of idolatry, with the
purpose of placing before the German people in the strongest
and most revolting language the abomination by which he
will have it that the Papacy has dishonoured and degraded
the world, through its man-made ordinances. Yet the very
words in which he wrote, quite apart from their blatant
untruth, were surely debasing. In the same writing he also
expresses himself most unworthily regarding the state of
voluntary celibacy and its alleged moral and physical
consequences.<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a></p>

<p>Here again it has been urged on Luther’s behalf, that
people in his day were familiar with such plain speaking.
Yet Luther himself felt at times how unsuitable, nay,
revolting, his language was, hence his excuses to his hearers
and readers for his want of consideration, and also his
attempt to take shelter in Holy Writ.<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> That people then
were ready to put up with more in sermons is undeniable.
Catholic preachers are to be met with before Luther’s day
who, although they do not speak in the same tone as he,
do go very far in their well-meant exhortations regarding
sexual matters, for instance, regarding the conjugal due in
all its moral bearings. Nor is it true to say that such things
occur only in Latin outlines or sketches of sermons, intended
for preacher rather than people, for they are also to be found
in German sermons actually preached. This disorder even
called forth a sharp rebuke from a Leipzig theologian who
was also a great opponent of Luther’s, viz. Hieronymus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Dungersheim.<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a>&mdash;In none of the Catholic preachers thus
censured, do we, however, find quite the same seasoning
we find in Luther, nor do they have recourse to such, simply
to spice their rhetoric or their polemics, or to air new views
on morality.</p>

<p>His contemporaries even, more particularly some
Catholics, could not see their way to repeat what he had
said on sexual matters.<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> “It must be conceded” that
Luther’s language on sexual questions was “at times
repulsively outspoken, nay, coarse, and that not only to
our ears but even to those of his more cultured contemporaries.”
Thus a Protestant writer.<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> Another admits
with greater reserve: “There are writings of Luther’s
in which he exceeds the limits of what was then usual.”<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Certain unseemly anecdotes from the Table-Talk deserve
to be mentioned here; told in the course of conversation
while the wine-cup went the rounds, they may well be
reckoned as instances of that “buffoonery” for which
Melanchthon reproves Luther. Many of them are not only
to be found in Bindseil’s “<i>Colloquia</i>” based on the Latin
collection of Lauterbach, and in the old Latin collection of
Rebenstock, but have left traces in the original notes of the
Table-Talk, for instance, in those of Schlaginhaufen and
Cordatus. It is not easy to understand why Luther should
have led the conversation to such topics; in fact, these
improper stories and inventions would appear to have
merely served the company to while away the time.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">For example, Luther amuses the company with the tale of a
Spandau Provost who was a hermaphrodite, lived in a nunnery
and bore a child;<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> with another, of a peasant, who, after listening
to a sermon on the use of Holy Water as a detergent of sin,
proceeded to put what he had heard into practice in an indecent
fashion;<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> with another of self-mutilated eunuchs, in telling
which he is unable to suppress an obscene joke concerning himself.<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>
He entertains the company with some far from witty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
indeed entirely tactless and indecent stories, for instance, about
the misfortune of a concubine who had used ink in mistake for
ointment;<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> of the Beghine who, when violence was offered her,
refused to scream because silence was enjoined after Compline;<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a>
of a foolish young man’s interview with his doctor;<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> of an
obscene joke at the expense of a person uncovered;<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> of a young
man’s experience with his bathing dress;<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> of women who in
shameless fashion prayed for a husband;<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> of the surprise of
Duke Hans, the son of Duke George of Saxony, by his steward, etc.<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a></p>

<p>These stories, in Bindseil’s “Colloquia,” are put with the
filthy verses on Lemnius,<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> the “<i>Merdipoeta</i>,” and form a fit
sequence to the account of Lustig, the cook, and the substitute
he used for sauces.<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a></p>

<p>These anecdotes are all related more or less in detail, but,
apart from them, we have plentiful indelicate sayings and jokes
and allusions to things not usually mentioned in society, sufficient
in fact to fill a small volume.</p>

<p>Luther, for instance, jests in unseemly fashion “amid
laughter” on the difference in mind and body which distinguishes
man from woman, and playfully demonstrates from the formation
of their body that his Catherine and women in general must
necessarily be deficient in wit.<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> An ambiguous sally at the
expense of virginity and the religious life, addressed to the ladies
who were usually present at these evening entertainments, was
received with awkward silence and a laugh.<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a></p>

<p>On another occasion the subject of the conversation was the
female breasts, it being queried whether they were “an ornament”
or intended for the sake of the children.<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> Then again
Luther, without any apparent reason, treats, and with great lack
of delicacy, of the circumstances and difficulties attending
confinement;<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> he also enters fully into the troubles of pregnancy,<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a>
and, to fill up an interval, tells a joke concerning the womb of
the Queen of Poland.<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Table-Talk Luther takes an opportunity of praising the
mother’s womb and does so with a striking enthusiasm, after
having exclaimed: “No one can sufficiently extol marriage.”
“Now, in his old age,” he understood this gift of God. Every
man, yea, Christ Himself, came from a mother’s womb.<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a></p>

<p>Among the passages which have been altered or suppressed in
later editions from motives of propriety comes a statement in the
Table-Talk concerning the Elector Johann Frederick, who was
reputed a hard drinker. In Aurifaber’s German Table-Talk the
sense of the passage is altered, and in the old editions of Stangwald
and Selnecker the whole is omitted.<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a></p>

<p>Of the nature of his jests the following from notes of the Table-Talk
gives a good idea: “It will come to this,” he said to
Catherine Bora, “that a man will take more than one wife.” The
Doctoress replied: “Tell that to the devil!” The Doctor proceeded:
Here is the reason, Katey: a wife can have only one
child a year, but the husband several. Katey replied: “Paul
says: ‘Let everyone have his own wife.’ Whereupon the
Doctor retorted: ‘His own,’ but not ‘only one,’ that you won’t
find in Paul. The Doctor teased his wife for a long time in this
way, till at last she said: ‘Sooner than allow this, I would go
back to the convent and leave you with all the children.’”<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a></p>

<p>When the question of his sanction of Philip of Hesse’s bigamy
and the scandal arising from it came under discussion, his
remarks on polygamy were not remarkable for delicacy. He
says: “Philip (Melanchthon) is consumed with grief about it....
And yet of what use is it?... I, on the contrary am a
hard Saxon and a peasant.... The Papists could have seen
how innocent we are, but they refused to do so, and so now they
may well look the Hessian ‘<i>in anum</i>.’ ... Our sins are pardonable,
but those of the Papists, unpardonable; for they are
contemners of Christ, have crucified Him afresh and defend their
blasphemy wittingly and wilfully. What are they trying to get
out of it [the bigamy]? They slay men, but we work for our
living and marry many wives.” “This he said with a merry air
and amid much laughter,” so the chronicler relates. “God is
determined to vex the people, and if it comes to my turn I shall
give them the best advice and tell them to look Marcolfus ‘<i>in
anum</i>,’” etc.<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> On rising from table he said very cheerfully: “I
will not give the devil and the Papists a chance of making me
uneasy. God will put it right, and to Him we must commend the
whole Church.”<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> By such trivialities did he seek to escape his
burden of oppression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>On one occasion he said he was going to ask the Elector to
give orders that everybody should “fill themselves with drink”;
then perhaps they would abandon this vice, seeing that people
were always ready to do the opposite of what was commanded;
what gave rise to this speech on drinking was the arrival of three
young men, slightly intoxicated, accompanied by a musical
escort. The visitors interrupted the conversation, which had
turned on the beauty of women.<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a></p>

<p>Many of Luther’s letters, as well as his sermons, lectures and
Table-Talk, bear sad witness to his unseemly language. It may
suffice here to mention one of the most extraordinary of these
letters, while incidentally remarking, that, from the point of
view of history, the passages already cited, or yet to be quoted,
must be judged of in the light of the whole series, in which alone
they assume their true importance. In a letter written in the
first year of his union, to his friend Spalatin, who though also
a priest was likewise taking a wife, he says: “The joy at your
marriage and at my own carries me away”; the words which
follow were omitted in all the editions (Aurifaber, De Wette,
Walch), Enders being the first to publish them from the original.
They are given in the note below.<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Luther himself was at times inclined to be ashamed
of his ways of speaking, and repeatedly expresses regret,
without, however, showing any signs of improvement. We
read in Cordatus’s Diary that (in 1527, during his illness) “he
asked pardon for the frivolous words he had often spoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
with the object of banishing the melancholy of a weak
flesh, not with any evil intent.”<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> At such moments he
appears to have remembered how startling a contrast his
speeches and jests presented to the exhortation of St. Paul
to his disciples, and to all the preachers of the Gospel:
“Make thyself a pattern to all men ... by a worthy mode
of life; let thy conversation be pure and blameless” (Titus
ii. 7 f.). “Be a model to the faithful in word, in act, in
faith and charity, in chastity” (1 Tim. iv. 12).</p>

<p>It would be wrong to believe that he ever formally declared
foul speaking to be permissible. It has been said that, in
any case in theory, he had no objection to it, and, that, in
a letter, he even recommends it. The passage in question,
found in an epistle addressed to Prince Joachim of Anhalt,
who was much troubled with temptations to melancholy,
runs thus: “It is true that to take pleasure in sin is the
devil, but to take pleasure in the society of good, pious
people in the fear of God, sobriety and honour is well
pleasing to God, even with possibly a word or ‘Zötlein’
too much.”<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> The expression “Zötlein” (allied with the
French “sottise”) did not, however, then bear the bad
meaning suggested by the modern German word “Zote,”
and means no more than a jest or merry story; that such a
meaning was conveyed even by the word “Zote” itself can
readily be proved.</p>

<p>Especially was it Luther’s practice to load his polemics
with a superabundance of filthy allusions to the baser
functions of the body; at times, too, we meet therein
expressions and imagery positively indecent.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">In his work “Vom Schem Hamphoras” against the Jews he
revels in scenes recalling that enacted between Putiphar’s wife
and Joseph, though here it is no mere temptation but actual
mutual sin; the tract contains much else of the same character.<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a>
In the notorious tract entitled “Wider Hans Worst,” which he
wrote against Duke Henry of Brunswick (1541), he begins
by comparing him with a “common procuress walking the street
to seize, capture and lead astray honest maidens”;<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> he gradually
works himself up into such a state of excitement as to describe
the Church of Rome as the “real devil’s whore”; nay, the
“archdevil’s whore,” the “shameless prostitute” who dwells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
in a “whores’ church” and houses of ill-fame, and compared
with whom, as we have already heard him say elsewhere, “common
city whores, field whores, country whores and army whores”<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a>
may well be deemed saints. In this work such figures of speech
occur on almost every page. Elsewhere he describes the motions
of the “Roman whore” in the most repulsive imagery.<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a></p>

<p>The term “whore” is one of which he is ever making use,
more particularly in that connection in which he feels it will be
most shocking to Catholics, viz. in connection with professed
religious. Nor does he hesitate to use this word to describe
human reason as against faith. In such varied and frenzied
combinations is the term met with in his writings that one stands
aghast. As he remarked on one occasion to his pupil Schlaginhaufen,
people would come at last to look upon him as a pimp.
He had been asked to act as intermediary in arranging a marriage:
“Write this down,” he said, “Is it not a nuisance? Am I
expected to provide also the women with husbands? Really
they seem to take me for a pander.”<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Even holy things were not safe in Luther’s hands, but
ran the risk of being vilified by outrageous comparisons
and made the subject of improper conversations.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">According to Lauterbach’s Diary, for instance, Luther discoursed
in 1538 on the greatness of God and the wisdom manifest
in creation; in this connection he holds forth before the assembled
company on the details of generation and the shape of the female
body. He then passes on to the subject of regeneration: “We
think we can instruct God ‘<i>in regenerationis et salvationis
articulo</i>,’ we like to dispute at great length on infant baptism
and the occult virtue of the sacraments, and, all the while, poor
fools that we are, we do not know ‘<i>unde sint stercora in
ventre</i>.’”<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> Over the beer-can the conversation turns on temperance,
and Luther thereupon proposes for discussion an idea of
Plato’s on procreation;<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> again he submits an ostensibly difficult
“<i>casus</i>” regarding the girl who becomes a mother on the frontier
of two countries;<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> he relates the tale of the woman who “<i>habitu
viri et membro ficto</i>” “<i>duas uxores duxit</i>”;<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> he dilates on a
“marvellous” peculiarity of the female body, which one would
have thought of a nature to interest a physician rather than a
theologian.<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> He also treats of the Bible passage according to
which woman must be veiled “on account of the angels” (1 Cor.
xi. 11), adding with his customary vulgarity: “And I too must
wear breeches on account of the girls.”<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> When the conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
turned on the marriage of a young fellow to a lady of a certain
age he remarked, that at such nuptials the words “Increase
and multiply” ought not to be used; as the poet says: “<i>Arvinam
quaerunt multi in podice porci</i>,” surely a useless search.<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> The
reason “why God was so angry with the Pope” was, he elsewhere
informs his guests, because he had robbed Him of the fruit of
the body. “We should have received no blessing unless God had
implanted our passions in us. But to the spark present in both
man and wife the children owe their being; even though our
children are born ugly we love them nevertheless.”<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a>&mdash;He then
raises his thoughts to God and exclaims: “Ah, beloved Lord
God, would that all had remained according to Thine order and
creation.” But what the Pope had achieved by his errors was
well known: “We are aware how things have gone hitherto.”
“The Pope wanted to enforce celibacy and to improve God’s
work.” But the monks and Papists “ ... are consumed with
concupiscence and the lust of fornication.”<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a>&mdash;Take counsel with
someone beforehand, he says, “in order that you may not repent
after the marriage. But be careful that you are not misled by
advice and sophistry, else you may find yourself with a sad handful
... then He Who drives the wheel, i.e. God, will jeer at you.
But that you should wish to possess one who is pretty, pious
and wealthy, nay, my friend ... it will fare with you as it did
with the nuns who were given carved Jesus’s and who cast
about for others who at least were living and pleased them
better.”<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Thus does Luther jumble together unseemly fancies,
coarse concessions to sensuality and praise for broken vows,
with thoughts of the Divine.</p>

<p>Anyone who regards celibacy and monastic vows from the
Catholic standpoint may well ask how a man intent on
throwing mud at the religious state, a man who had broken
his most sacred pledges by his marriage with a nun, could
be in a position rightly to appreciate the delicate blossoms
which in every age have sprung up on the chaste soil of
Christian continence in the lives of countless priests and
religious, not in the cloister alone, but also in the world
without?</p>

<p>Of his achievements in this field, of his having trodden
celibacy under foot, Luther was very proud. To the success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of his unholy efforts he himself gave testimony in the words
already mentioned: “I am like unto Abraham [the Father
of the Faithful] for I am the progenitor of all the monks,
priests and nuns [who have married], and of all the many
children they have brought into the world; I am the father
of a great people.”<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a></p>

<p>By his attacks on celibacy and the unseemliness of his
language Luther, nevertheless, caused many to turn away
from him in disgust. Duke Anton Ulrich of Brunswick, who
reverted to Catholicism in 1710, states in a writing on the
step he had taken, that it was due to some extent to his
disgust at Luther’s vulgarity. “What writer,” he says,
“has left works containing more filth?... Such was his
way of writing that his followers at the present day are
ashamed of it.” He had compared the character of this
reformer of the Church, so he tells us, with that of the
apostolic men of ancient times. In striking contrast they
were “pious, God-fearing men, of great virtue, temperate,
humble, abstemious, despising worldly possessions, not
given to luxury, having only the salvation of souls
before their eyes”; particularly did they differ from
Luther in the matter of purity and chastity.<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a></p>

<h3>6. Contemporary Complaints. Later False Reports</h3>

<p>Those of his contemporaries who speak unfavourably of
Luther’s private life belong to the ranks of his opponents.
His own followers either were acquainted only with what
was to his advantage, or else took care not to commit themselves
to any public disapproval. To give blind credence in
every case to the testimony of his enemies would, of course,
be opposed to the very rudiments of criticism, but equally
alien to truth and justice would it be to reject it unheard.
In each separate case it must depend on the character of
the witness and on his opportunity for obtaining reliable
information and forming a just opinion, how much we credit
his statements.</p>

<p>Concerning the witnesses first to be heard, we must bear
in mind, that, hostile as they were to Luther, they had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
opportunity of seeing him at close quarters. How far their
statements are unworthy of credence (for that they are
not to be taken exactly at their word is clear enough) cannot
be determined here in detail. The mere fact, however, that,
at Wittenberg and in Saxony, some should have written
so strongly against Luther would of itself lead us to pay
attention to their words. In the case of the other witnesses
we shall be able to draw some sort of general inference from
their personal circumstances as to the degree of credibility
to be accorded them. While writers within Luther’s camp
were launching out into fulsome panegyrics of their leader,
it is of interest to listen to what the other side had to say,
even though, there too, the speakers should allow themselves
to be carried away to statements manifestly exaggerated.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Simon Lemnius, the Humanist, who, owing to his satirical
epigrams on the Wittenberg professor&mdash;whom he had known
personally&mdash;was inexorably persecuted by the latter, wrote, in
his “Apology,” about 1539, the following description of Luther’s
life and career. This and the whole “Apology,” was suppressed
by the party attacked; the later extracts from this writing,
published by Schelhorn (1737) and Hausen (1776), passed over
it in silence, till it was at last again brought to light in 1892:
“While Luther boasts of being an evangelical bishop, how comes
it that he lives far from temperately? For he is in the habit of
overloading himself with food and drink; he has his court of
flatterers and adulators; he has his Venus [Bora] and wants
scarcely anything which could minister to his comfort and
luxury.”<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> “He has written a pamphlet against me, in which,
as both judge and authority, he condemns and mishandles me.
Surely no pastor would arrogate to himself such authority in
temporal concerns. He deprives the bishops of their temporal
power, but himself is a tyrant; he circulates opprobrious and
quite execrable writings against illustrious Princes. He flatters
one Prince and libels another. What is this but to preach revolt
and to pave the way for a general upheaval and the downfall of
our States?... It is greatly to be feared, that, should war
once break out, first Germany will succumb miserably and then
the whole Roman Empire go to ruin. Meanwhile Luther sits like
a dictator at Wittenberg and rules; what he says must be
taken as law.”<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>By the Anabaptists Luther’s and his followers’ “weak life”
was severely criticised about 1525. Here we refer only cursorily
to the statements already quoted,<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> in order to point out that
these opponents based their theological strictures on a general,
and, in itself, incontrovertible argument: “Where Christian
faith does not issue in works, there the faith is neither rightly
preached nor rightly accepted.”<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> In Luther they were unable
to discern a “spark of Christianity,” though his “passionate
and rude temper” was evident enough.<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> “The witless, self-indulgent
lump of flesh at Wittenberg,” Dr. Luther, was not
only the “excessively ambitious Dr. Liar, but also a proud fool,”<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a>
whose “defiant teaching and selfish ways” were far removed
from what Christ and His Apostles had enjoined. In spite of the
manifest spiritual desolation of the people Luther was wont to
sit “with the beer-swillers” and to eat “sumptuous repasts”;
he had even tolerated “open harlotry” on the part of some of
the members of the University although, as a rule, he “manfully
opposed” this vice.<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a></p>

<p>Catholic censors were even stronger in their expression of indignation.
Dungersheim of Leipzig, in spite of his polemics an
otherwise reliable witness, though rather inclined to rhetoric,
in the fourth decade of the century reproached him in his “Thirty
Articles” for leading a “life full of scandal”; he likewise
appeals to some who had known him intimately, and was ready,
if necessary, “to relate everything, down to the circumstances
and the names.”<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> As a matter of fact, however, this theologian
never defined his charges.</p>

<p>From the Duchy of Saxony, too, came the indignant voice of
bluff Duke George, whom Luther had attacked and slandered
in so outrageous a fashion: “Out upon you, you forsworn and
sacrilegious fellow, Martin Luther (may God pardon me), public-house
keeper for all renegade monks, nuns and apostates!”<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a>
He calls him “Luther, you drunken swine,” you “most unintelligent
bacchant and ten times dyed horned beast of whom
Daniel spoke in chapter viii., etc.”<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> Luther had called this
Prince a “bloodhound”; he is paid back in his own coin:
“You cursed, perjured bloodhound”; he was the “arch-murderer,”
body and soul, of the rebellious peasants, “the biggest
murderer and bloodhound ever yet seen on the surface of the
globe.”<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> “You want us to believe that no one has written more
beautifully of the Emperor and the Empire than yourself. If
what you have written of his Imperial Majesty is beautiful, then
my idea of beauty is all wrong; for it would be easy to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
tipsy peasants in plenty who can write nine times better than
you.”<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a></p>

<p>From the theologian Ambrosius Catharinus we hear some
details concerning Luther’s private life.</p>

<p>On the strength of hearsay reports, picked up, so it would
appear, from some of the visitors to the Council of Trent in 1546
and 1547, this Italian, who was often over-ardent both in attack
and defence, wrote in the latter year his work: “<i>De consideratione
praesentium temporum libri quattuor.</i>” Here he says:
“Quite reliable witnesses tell me of Luther, that he frequently
honoured the wedding feasts of strangers by his presence, went
to see the maidens dance and occasionally even led the round
dance himself. They declare that he sometimes got up from the
banquets so drunk and helpless that he staggered from side to
side, and had to be carried home on his friends’ shoulders.”<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a></p>

<p>As an echo of the rumours current in Catholic circles we have
already mentioned elsewhere the charges alleged in 1524 by
Ferdinand the German King, and related by Luther himself,
viz. that he “passed his time with light women and at playing
pitch-and-toss in the taverns.”<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> We have also recorded the
vigorous denunciation of the Catholic Count, Hoyer of Mansfeld,
which dates from a somewhat earlier period; this came from a
man whose home was not far from Luther’s, and to whose character
no exception has been taken. Hoyer wrote that whereas
formerly at Worms he had been a “good Lutheran,” he had
now “found that Luther was nothing but a knave,” who, as
the way was at Mansfeld, filled himself with drink, was fond of
keeping company with pretty women, and led a loose life, for
which reason he, the Count, had “fallen away altogether.”<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a>
The latter statements refer to a period somewhere about 1522,
i.e. previous to Luther’s marriage. With regard to that critical
juncture in the year 1525 some consideration must be given to
what Bugenhagen says of Luther’s marriage in his letter to
Spalatin, which really voices the opinion of Luther’s friends at
Wittenberg: “Evil tales were the cause of Dr. Martin’s becoming
a married man so unexpectedly.”<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> The hope then expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
by Melanchthon, that marriage would sober Luther and that he
would lay aside his unseemliness,<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> was scarcely to be realised.
Melanchthon, however, no longer complains of it, having at length
grown resigned. Yet he continued to regret Luther’s bitterness
and irritability: “Oh, that Luther would only be silent! I had
hoped that as he advanced in years his many difficulties and
riper experience would make him more gentle; but I cannot help
seeing that in reality he is growing even more violent than before....
Whenever I think of it I am plunged into deep distress.”<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a></p>

<p>Leo Judæ, one of the leaders of the Swiss Reformation, and
an opponent of Wittenberg, “accuses Luther of drunkenness
and all manner of things; such a bishop [he says] he would not
permit to rule over even the most insignificant see.” Thus in a
letter to Bucer on April 24, 1534, quoted by Theodore Kolde in
his “Analecta Lutherana,”<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> who, unfortunately, does not give
the actual text. According to Kolde, Leo Judæ continues:
“Even the devil confesses Christ. I believe that since the
time of the Apostles no one has ever spoken so disgracefully
(‘<i>turpiter</i>’) as Luther, so ridiculously and irreligiously. Unless
we resist him betimes, what else can we expect of the man but
that he will become another Pope, who orders things first one
way then another (‘<i>fingit et refingit</i>’), consigns this one to Satan
and that one to heaven, puts one man out of the Church and
receives another into it again, until things come to such a pass
that he acts as Judge over all whilst no one pays the least attention
to him?” With the exception of rejecting infant baptism,
so Kolde goes on, Luther appeared to Judæ no better than
Schwenckfeld, with whom Bucer would have nought to do;
Judæ proceeds: “Not for one hundred thousand crowns would
I have all evangelical preachers to resemble Luther; no one
could compare with him for his wealth of abuse and for his
woman-like, impotent agitation; his clamour and readiness of
tongue are nowhere to be equalled.”<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a></p>

<p>Powerful indeed is the rhetorical outburst of Zwingli in a letter
to Conrad Sam the preacher of Ulm, dated August 30, 1528:
“May I be lost if he [Luther] does not surpass Faber in foolishness,
Eck in impurity, Cochlæus in impudence, and to sum it up
shortly, all the vicious in vice.”<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a></p>

<p>Heinrich Bullinger, Zwingli’s successor, attacks Luther in his
“Warhafften Bekanntnuss” of 1545 in reply to the latter’s
“Kurtz Bekentnis”: “The booklet [Luther’s] is so crammed
with devils, unchristian abuse, immoral, wicked, and unclean
words, anger, rage and fury that all who read it without being
as mad as the author must be greatly surprised and astonished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
that so old, gifted, experienced and reputable a man cannot
keep within bounds but must break out into such rudeness and
filth as to ruin his cause in the eyes of all right-thinking men.”<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a></p>

<p>Johann Agricola, at one time Luther’s confidant and well
acquainted with all the circumstances of his life, but later his
opponent on the question of Antinomianism, left behind him
such abuse of Luther that, as E. Thiele says, “it is difficult to
believe such language proceeds, not from one of Luther’s Roman
adversaries, but from a man who boasts of having possessed his
special confidence.” He almost goes so far, according to Thiele,
as to portray him as a “drunken profligate”; he says, “the
pious man,” the “man of God (‘<i>vir Dei</i>’),” allowed himself to
be led astray by the “men of Belial,” i.e. by false friends, and
was inclined to be suspicious; he bitterly laments the scolding
and cursing of which his works were full. One of his writings,
“Against the Antinomians” (1539), was, he says, “full of lies”;
in it Luther had accused him in the strongest terms and before
the whole world of being a liar; it was “an abominable lie”
when Luther attributed to him the statement, that God was not
to be invoked and that there was no need of performing good
works. When Luther’s tract was read from the pulpit even the
Wittenbergers boggled at these lies and said: “Now we see
what a monk is capable of thinking and doing.” Agricola also
describes Luther’s immediate hearers and pupils at Wittenberg
as mere “Sodomites,” and the town as the “Sister of Sodom.”<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a>
Such is the opinion of this restless, passionate man, who bitterly
resented the wrong done him by Luther. (See vol. v., xxix. 3.)</p></div>

<p class="p1">Not all the above accusations are entirely baseless, for
some are confirmed by other proofs quite above suspicion.
The charge of habitual drunkenness, as will be shown below
(xvii. 7), must be allowed to drop; so likewise must that of
having been a glutton and of having constantly pandered
to sensual passion; that Luther sanctioned immorality
among his friends and neighbours can scarcely be squared
with his frequent protests against the disorders rife at the
University of Wittenberg; finally, we have to reduce to their
proper proportions certain, in themselves justifiable, subjects
of complaint. That, however, everything alleged against
him was a pure invention of his foes, only those can believe
whom prejudice blinds to everything which might tell
against their hero.</p>

<p>The charges of the Swiss theologians, though so strongly
expressed, refer in the main to Luther’s want of restraint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
in speech and writing; the vigour of their defensive tactics
it is easy enough to understand, and, at any rate, Luther’s
writings are available for reference and allow us to appreciate
how far their charges were justified.</p>

<p>Another necessary preliminary remark is that no detailed
accusation was ever brought against Luther of having had
relations with any woman other than his wife; nothing of
this nature appears to have reached the ears of the writers
in question. Due weight must here be given to Luther’s
constant anxiety not to compromise the Evangel by any
personal misconduct. (See vol. ii., p. 133.) Luther, naturally
enough, was ever in a state of apprehension as to what
his opponents might, rightly or wrongly, impute to him.
That he was liable to be misrepresented, particularly by
foreigners (Aleander [vol. ii., p. 78] and Catharinus), is plain
from the examples given above. The distance at which
Catharinus resided from Wittenberg led him to lend a
willing ear to the reports brought by “reliable men,” needless
to say opponents of Luther.</p>

<p>The deep dislike felt by faithful Catholics for the Wittenberg
professor and their lively abhorrence for certain moral
doctrines expressed by him in extravagant language,<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a>
formed a fertile soil for the growth of legends; some of these,
met with amongst the literary defenders of Catholicism
after Luther’s death, have been propagated even in modern
times, and accordingly call for careful examination at the
hands of the Catholic critic. Where Luther himself speaks we
are on safe ground, as the method employed above shows.
Where, however, we have to listen to strangers doubt must
needs arise, and the task of discriminating becomes inevitable,
owing to the speaker’s probable prejudice either for or
against Luther. This applies, as we have already seen, even
to Luther’s contemporaries, but it holds good even more
as we approach modern times, when, in the heat of controversy,
things were said concerning alleged historical facts,
for instance, Luther’s immorality, which were certainly quite
unknown to his own contemporaries. Many of Luther’s
accusers had never read his works, possibly had not even
troubled to look up a single one of the facts or passages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
cited. We must, however, remember&mdash;a fact which serves
to some extent to explain the regrettable lack of exactitude
and discernment&mdash;that the prohibition of reading Luther’s
writings was on the whole strictly enforced by the authorities
of the Church and conscientiously obeyed by the
faithful, even by writers. Only rarely in olden days<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> were
dispensations granted. Thus, when attacking Luther,
writers were wont to utilise passages quoted by earlier
writers, often truncated excerpts given without the context.
Misunderstood or entirely incorrect accounts of
events connected with his life were accepted as facts, of
which now, thanks to his works and particularly to his
letters, we are in a better position to judge. Many seemed
unaware that the misunderstandings were growing from
age to age, the reason being that instead of taking as
authorities the best and oldest Luther controversialists,
those of a later date were preferred in whose writings facts
and quotations had already undergone embellishment.
In this wise the older popular literature came to attribute to
Luther the strangest statements and to make complaints
for which no foundation existed in fact. Incautious interpretation
by more recent writers, whose training scarcely
fitted them for the task and who might have learnt better
by consulting Luther’s works and letters, has led to a still
greater increase of the evil.</p>

<p>In the following pages we propose to examine rather more
narrowly certain statements which appear in the older and
also more recent controversial works.</p>

<h3><i>Had Luther three children of his own apart from those born of his
union with Bora?</i></h3>

<div class="pbq">

<p>By his wife Luther was father to five children, viz. Hans (1526),
Magdalene (1529), Martin (1531), Paul (1533) and Margaret
(1534).</p>

<p>The paternity of another child born of a certain Rosina
Truchsess, a servant in his house, has also been ascribed to him,
it being alleged that his references to this girl are very compromising.<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a>
The latter assertion, however, does not hold good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
if only we read the passages in an unprejudiced spirit; at most
they prove that Luther allowed his kindliness to get the better
of his caution in receiving into his house one who subsequently
proved herself to be both untruthful and immoral, and that,
when by her misconduct she had compromised her master and
his family, he was exceedingly angry with her. It is incorrect to
say that Rosina ever designated Luther as the father of her
baby.</p>

<p>The second child was one named Andreas, of whom Luther
is said to have spoken as his son. This boy, however, has been
proved to have been his nephew, Andreas Kaufmann, who was
brought up in Luther’s family. Only through a mistake of the
editor is he spoken of in the Table-Talk as “My Enders” and
“My son”; later a fresh alteration of the text resulted in:
“<i>filius meus Andreas</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a></p>

<p>The third child was said to have been referred to in the Table-Talk
as an “<i>adulter infans</i>,” in a passage where mention is made
of its having been suckled by Catherine during pregnancy. In
Aurifaber’s Table-Talk (1569 edition) “<i>adulterum infantem</i>” is,
however, a misprint for “<i>alterum infantem</i>,” which is the true
reading as it appears in the first (1568) edition. It is true that
the passage in question mentions of two of Luther’s own children,
that his wife was already with child before the first had been
weaned.<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a></p></div>

<h4><i>Luther and Catherine Bora.</i></h4>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">A letter which Luther wrote to his wife from Eisleben shortly
before the end of his life, when he was staying at the Court of the
Count of Mansfeld, has been taken as an admission of immorality:
“I am now, thanks be to God, in a good case were it not
for the pretty women who press me so hard that I again go in
fear and peril of unchastity.”<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> What exactly means this reference
to unchastity? As a matter of fact, after having partially
recovered from his malady, he is here seeking to allay his wife’s
anxiety by adopting a jesting tone, though perhaps exception
might be taken to the nature of his jest. That what he says was intended
as a joke is plain also from the superscription of the letter,
addressed to the “Pork dealer,” an allusion to her purchase
of a garden close to the Wittenberg pig-market. In the
letter he explains humorously to his anxious wife (this too
has been taken seriously), that his catarrh and giddiness had
been wholly caused by the Jews, viz. by a cold wind raised up
against him by them or their God (he was just then engaged in a
controversy with the Jews).&mdash;The superscriptions of the various
letters to Catherine and the jesting remarks they contain have
also been taken far too tragically. Luther was wont to address<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
her as deeply-learned dame, gracious lady, holy and careful lady,
most holy Katey, Doctoress, etc., also as My Lord Katey and
Gracious Lord Katey. It may be that the latter appellations
refer to a certain haughtiness peculiar to her; but it would be to
misunderstand him entirely to see in this or even in the name
“Kette” = chain, which he applies to her now and then, an
involuntary admission that he was bound by the fetters of a
self-willed wife. We have seen how he once spoke of her in a
letter previous to his marriage as his “mistress” (Metze), which
has led careless controversialists to fancy that Luther quite
openly had admitted that she was “his concubine” (vol. ii.,
p. 183). At any rate, not only was Luther’s language unseemly
in many of his letters and in his intercourse with his Wittenberg
circle, but this license of speech seems even to have infected
the ladies of the party, at least if we may credit Simon Lemnius
who, on the strength of what he had seen at Wittenberg, says
that the wives of Luther, Justus Jonas and Spalatin vied with
each other in indecent stories and confidences.<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> Thus we
cannot take it amiss if the Catholics of that day, to whose ears
came such rumours&mdash;doubtless already magnified&mdash;were too ready
to credit them and to give open expression to their surmises.
An instance of this is what Master Joachim von der Heyden
wrote, in 1528, to Catherine Bora, viz. that she had lived with
Luther before their marriage in shameful and open lewdness&mdash;<i>as
was said</i>.<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a></p></div>

<h4><i>Did Luther indulge in “the Worst Orgies” with the Escaped Nuns
in the Black Monastery of Wittenberg?</i></h4>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">To give an affirmative reply to this would call for very strong
proofs, which, in point of fact, are not forthcoming. The passage
in the Latin Table-Talk<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> quoted in justification contains nothing
of the sort, but, strange to say, a very fine exhortation to continence.
For this reason we must again consider it, though it has
already been dealt with. The exhortation commences with the
words: “God is Almighty, Eternal, Merciful, Longsuffering,
Chaste, etc. He loves chastity, purity, modesty. He aids and
preserves it by the sacred institution of marriage in order that
[as Paul says] each one may possess his vessel in sanctification,
free from unbridled lust. He punishes rape, adultery, fornication,
incest and secret sins with infamy and terrible bodily
consequences. He warns such sinners that they shall have no
part in the Kingdom of God. Therefore let us be watchful in
prayer,” etc. It is true, however, that this pious exhortation is
set off by frivolous remarks, and it is probably one of these
which suggested the erroneous reference. Luther here speaks of
his young “relative,” Magdalene Kaufmann&mdash;a girl of marriageable
age living in his house&mdash;and of two other maidens of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
same age, remarking that formerly people had been ready for
marriage at an earlier age than now, but that he was ready to
vouch for the fitness of these three wenches for conjugal work,
even to staking his wife on it, etc. Of any “wicked orgies” we
hear nothing whatever. Further, it is inexact to state, as has
been done, that Luther was surrounded in “his dwelling” by
nuns whom he had given a lodging. Neither before nor after
his marriage did they stay with him permanently; as already
stated (vol. ii., p. 138) he either handed over the escaped nuns
to their friends or lodged them in families at Wittenberg. Only
on one occasion, in September, 1525, when in the hurry it was
impossible to find accommodation for a new band of fugitives,
did he receive them temporarily, possibly only for a few days,
in the great “Black Monastery.”<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> There, as he himself then
expressed it, he was “<i>privatus pater familias</i>.”</p></div>

<h4><i>The Passages “which will not bear repetition.”</i></h4>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">The popular writer who is responsible for the tale of the
“orgies” also declares, there are “other admissions of Luther’s”
“which will not bear repetition.” No such admissions exist.
The phrase that this or that will not bear repetition is, however,
a favourite one among controversialists of a certain school,
though very misleading; many, no doubt, will have been quite
disappointed on looking up the passages in question in Luther’s
writings to find in them nothing nearly so bad as they had been
led to expect; this, indeed, was one of the reasons which impelled
us rigidly to exclude from the present work any reservation
and to give in full even the most revolting passages. Of one of
Luther’s Theses against the theologians of Louvain we read, for
instance, in a controversial pamphlet which is not usually
particular about the propriety of its quotations, that the author
does “not dare reproduce it”; yet, albeit coarsely worded, the
passage in question really contains nothing so very dreadful, and,
as for its coarseness, it is merely such as every reader of Luther’s
works is prepared to encounter. The passage thus incriminated,
which reads comically enough in its scholastic presentation
(Thesis 31), runs as follows: “<i>Deinde nihil ex scripturis, sed
omnia ex doctrinis hominum ructant [Lovanienses], vomunt et
cacant in ecclesiam, non suam sed Dei viventis</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> The German
translation in the original edition of 1545 slightly aggravates the
wording of the Thesis.<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Two other assertions to Luther’s disadvantage have
something in common; one represents as the starting-point
of the whole movement which he inaugurated his desire to
“wed a girl”; the other makes him declare, three years
before the end of his life and as the sum-total of his experience,
that the lot of the hog is the most enviable goal of
happiness.<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> A third statement goes back to his early youth
and seeks to find the explanation of his later faults in a
temptation succumbed to when he was little more than a
boy. The facts, alleged to belong to his early history, may
be taken in connection with kindred matters and examined
more carefully than was possible when relating the details
of his early development. After that we shall deal with the
story of the “hog.”</p>

<h4><i>Did Luther, as a Young Monk, say that he would push on until
he could wed a Girl?</i></h4>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Such is the story, taken from a Catholic sermon preached in
1580 by Wolfgang Agricola and long exploited in popular anti-Lutheran
writings as a proof that Luther really made such a
statement. A “document,” an “ancient deed,” nay, even a
confidential “letter to his friend Spalatin,” containing the
statement have also been hinted at; all this, however, is non-existent;
all that we have is the story in the sermon.</p>

<p>The sermon, which is to be found in an old Ingolstadt print,<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a>
contains all sorts of interesting religious memories of Spalatin,
the influential friend of Luther’s youthful days. The preacher
was Dean in the little town of Spalt, near Nuremberg, Spalatin’s
birthplace, from which the latter was known by the name of
Spalatinus, his real name being Burkard. The recollections are
by no means all of them equally vouched for, and hence we
must go into them carefully in order rightly to appreciate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
value of each. We shall see that those dealing with Luther’s
love-adventures are the least to be trusted.</p>

<p>Agricola first gives some particulars concerning Spalatin’s
past, which seem founded on reliable tradition; in this his
object is to confirm Catholics in their fidelity to the Church.
Spalatin, in the course of a journey, came to his birthplace
and, with forty-six gulden, founded a yearly Mass for
his parents, the anniversary having been kept ever since, “even
to the present day.” It is evident that this was vouched for by
written documents. To say, as some Protestants have, that this
and what follows is the merest invention, is not justified. Agricola
goes on to inform us that Spalatin settled the finances of the family,
and that, on this occasion, he presented to the township of Spalt
a picture of Our Lady, which had once belonged to the Schlosskirche
of Wittenberg, requesting, however, that, out of consideration
for Luther, the fact of his being the donor should be kept
secret until after his death. Agricola also tells how, during his
stay, Spalatin invited the “then Dean, Thomas Ludel,” with
the members of the chapter to be his guests, and in turn accepted
their hospitality; he also attended the Catholic sermons in order
to ascertain how the Word of God was preached. Thomas
Ludel, the Dean, found opportunity quite frankly to discuss
Spalatin’s religious attitude, whereupon the latter said: “Stick
to your own form of Divine Service,” nor did Spalatin shrink
from giving the same advice to the people. Every year, says
Agricola, the picture of Our Lady which he had presented was
placed on the High Altar to remind the faithful of the exhortation
of their fellow-citizen.<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> The picture in question is still to be
seen to-day at Spalt.<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> The narrator goes so far as to declare,
that during the Dean’s observations on his religious conduct
“the tears came to Spalatin’s eyes”; “I admit,” he said,
“that we carried things too far.... God be merciful to us all!”
From Luther’s correspondence we know that Spalatin, in later
days, was much disquieted by melancholy and temptations to
despair. Luther, by his letters, sought to inspire his friend as he
approached the close of his life with confidence in Christ, agreeably
with the tenets of the new Evangel.<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a></p>

<p>Almost all that Agricola here relates appears, from its local
colouring, to be absolutely reliable, but this is by no means the
case with what is of more interest to us, viz. the account of Luther
as prospective bridegroom which he appends to his stories of
Spalatin. The difference between this account and what has
gone before cannot fail to strike one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>According to this story of Agricola’s, set in a period some three-quarters
of a century earlier, Luther, as a young Augustinian, at
Erfurt struck up a friendship with Spalatin who was still studying
there. At the University were two other youths from Spalt,
George Ferber, who subsequently became Doctor, parish-priest
and Dean of Spalt, and Hans Schlahinhauffen. All four became
fast friends, and Luther was a frequent visitor at the house where
they lived with a widow who had a pretty daughter. He became
greatly enamoured of the girl and “taught her lace-making,”
until the mother forbade him the house. He often declared:
“Oh, Spalatin, Spalatin, you cannot believe how devoted I am
to this pretty maid; I will not die before I have brought things
to such a pass that I also shall be able to marry a nice girl.”
Eventually, with the assistance of Spalatin, Luther, so we are
told, introduced his innovations, partly in order to make himself
famous, partly in order to be able to marry a girl.<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a></p>

<p>It is hardly probable that Wolfgang Agricola himself invented
this story of the monk; more likely he found it amongst the
numerous tales concerning Spalatin current at Spalt. His
authority for the tale he does not give. It can scarcely have
emanated from Spalatin himself&mdash;for instance, have been told
by him on the occasion of the visit mentioned above&mdash;for then
Agricola would surely have said so. It more probably belongs to
that category of obscure myths clustering round the early days
of Luther’s struggle with the Church.</p>

<p>What is, however, of greater importance is that the monk’s
behaviour, as here described, does not tally with the facts known.
During his first stay at the Erfurt monastery Luther was not
by any means the worldly young man here depicted, and even
during his second sojourn there (autumn, 1508&mdash;autumn, 1510)
no one remarked any such tendency in him; on the contrary,
the seven Observantine priories chose him as their representative
at Rome, presumably because he was a man in whom they could
trust. We may call to mind that the then Cathedral Provost of
Magdeburg, Prince Adolf of Anhalt, received letters from him
at this time attesting his zeal for the “spiritual life and doctrine,”<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a>
and that Luther’s opponent, Cochlæus, from information
received from Luther’s brethren, gives him credit for the
careful observance of the Rule in the matter of spiritual exercises
and studies during his first years as a monk.<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> The notable change
in Luther’s outward mode of life took place only after his return
from Rome when he abandoned the cause of the Observantine
party.</p>

<p>Spalatin commenced his studies at Erfurt in 1498 and continued
them from 1502 at Wittenberg; thence, on their termination,
he returned to Erfurt in order to take up the position of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
tutor at a mansion, which he soon quitted to become (1505-1508)
spiritual preceptor in the neighbouring convent of Georgenthal.
Thus the date of his first stay at Erfurt was too early for him,
while himself a student, to have met Luther as a monk, seeing
that the latter only entered the monastery in 1505. His second
stay presents this further difficulty, that it is not likely that
Spalatin lived with the other students at the widow’s house, but,
first in a wealthy family, and, later, either in or near the convent.
Further, were the other two youths hailing from Spalt then at
Erfurt? A certain Johannes Schlaginhaufen from Spalt was
there in 1518 and is also mentioned as being at the University
in 1520. He is, perhaps, the same as the compiler of the Table-Talk
edited by Wilhelm Preger,<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> but, if so, he was not a fellow-student
of Luther’s at Erfurt. No other similar name appears
in the register. The name of the second, George Ferber, cannot
be found at all in the Erfurt University register, nor any Farber,
Färber or Tinctoris even with another Christian name. Thus
there are difficulties on every side.</p>

<p>Then again, the familiar visits to the girl, as though there had
been no Rule which debarred the young religious from such
intercourse. We know that even in 1516 the Humanist Mutian
had great trouble in obtaining permission for an Augustinian
frequently to visit his house at Erfurt, even accompanied by
another Friar.<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a></p>

<p>Hence, however deserving of credit Agricola’s other accounts
of Spalatin may be, we cannot accept his story of Luther’s
doings as a monk. Nor is this the only statement concerning
the earlier history of the Reformation in which Agricola has
gone astray. The story may have grown up at Spalt owing to
some misunderstanding of something said by George Ferber,
the Dean of Spalt, who was supposed to have been a fellow-student
of Luther’s at Erfurt, and who may possibly have
related tales of the young Augustinian’s early imprudence. It is
however possible, in fact not at all unlikely, that, in 1501, when
Luther was still a secular student at Erfurt, and according to
the above, a contemporary of Spalatin’s, he took a passing fancy
to a girl in the house where Spalatin boarded, and that, during
the controversies which accompanied the Reformation, a rumour
of this was magnified into the tale that, as a monk, Luther had
courted a girl, had been desirous of marrying, and, for this
reason, had quitted both his Order and the Church.</p></div>

<h4><i>Luther’s stay as a boy in Cotta’s house at Eisenach no ground for
a charge of immorality.</i></h4>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Entirely unfounded suspicions have been raised concerning
Luther’s residence in Frau Cotta’s house at Eisenach (vol. i.,
p. 5). There is not the slightest justification for thinking that
Frau Cotta&mdash;who has erroneously been described as a young
widow&mdash;acted from base motives in thus receiving the youth,
nor for the tale of his charming her by his playing on the lute or
the flute.</p>

<p>Cuntz (Conrad) Cotta, the husband of Ursula Cotta (her
maiden-name was Schalbe), was still living when Luther, at the
age of fifteen or sixteen, was so kindly received into the house
and thus dispensed from supplementing his small resources by
singing in the streets. Conrad’s name appears in 1505 in the
Eisenach registers as one of the parish representatives. His wife
Ursula, witness her tombstone, died in 1511.<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> How old she was
at the time she became acquainted with Luther cannot be
determined, but quite possibly, she, like her husband, was no
longer young. The date of death of two supposed sons of hers
would certainly tend to show that she was then still young, but
these two Cottas, as has been proved, were not her sons, though
they may have been nephews. Conrad Cotta is not known to
have had any children, and the fact of his being childless would
explain all the more readily Luther’s reception into his household.</p>

<p>Mathesius, in his frequently quoted historical sermons on
Luther,<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> says, that “a pious matron” admitted the poor scholar
to her table. He is referring to Ursula Cotta. The word matron
which he makes use of seems intended to denote rather respectability
than advanced age. That he should mention only the wife
is probably due to the fact that she, rather than her husband,
was Luther’s benefactress. He seems to have had the account
from Luther himself, who, it would appear, told him the story
together with the edifying cause of his reception. This Mathesius
relates in a way which excludes rather than suggests any thought
of dishonourable motives. He says that the matron conceived a
“yearning attraction for the boy on account of his singing and
his earnest prayer in the churches.” The expression “yearning
attraction,” which sounds somewhat strange to us, was not unusual
then and comes naturally to a preacher rather inclined to be
sentimental, as was Mathesius. Ratzeberger the physician, a
friend of Luther’s to whom the latter may also have spoken of
his stay at Eisenach, merely says, that the scholar “found board
and lodging at Cuntz Cotta’s.” Thus he credits the husband
with the act of charity.</p>

<p>Luther could not well have played the flute there, seeing that
he never learned to play that instrument; as for the lute, he
became proficient on it only during his academic years; nor does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
any source allude to musical entertainments taking place in the
Cotta household.</p>

<p>Luther relates later in the Table-Talk,<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> that he had learned this
saying from his “hostess at Eisenach,” i.e. Frau Cotta: “There
is nought dearer on earth than the love of woman to the man
who can win it.” This, however, affords no ground for thinking
evil. The saying was a popular one in general use and may quite
naturally refer to the love existing between husband and wife.
It is another question whether it was quite seemly on Luther’s
part to quote this saying as he did in his Glosses on the Bible,
in connection with the fine description of the “<i>mulier fortis</i>”
(Proverbs xxxi. 10 ff.), so distinguished for her virtue.</p></div>


<h4><i>Did Luther describe the lot of the Hog as the most enviable Goal
of Happiness?</i></h4>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">In view of the fear of death which he had often experienced
when lying on the bed of sickness, Luther, so we are told, came
to envy the lot of the hog, and to exclaim: “I am convinced that
anyone who has felt the anguish and terror of death would rather
be a pig than bear it for ever and ever.” That such are his words
is perfectly true, and he even goes on to give a graphic description
of the happy and comfortable life a pig leads until it comes under
the hand of the butcher, all due to its unacquaintance with
death.<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a></p>

<p>It should first be noted that, throughout the work in question,
“Von den Jüden und jren Lügen,” Luther is busy with the Jews.
He compares the happiness which, according to him, they await
from their Messias, with that enjoyed by the pig.<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> In his cynical
manner he concludes that the happiness of the pig was even to be
preferred to Jewish happiness, for the Jews would not be “secure
for a single hour” in the material happiness they expected, for
they would be oppressed by the “horrible burden and plague of
all men, viz. death,” seeing that they merely look for a temporal
king as their Messias, who shall procure them riches, mirth and
pleasure. Thereupon we get one of his customary outbursts:
“Were God to promise me no other Messias than him for whom
the Jews hope, I would very much rather be a pig than a man.”</p>

<p>Yet he proceeds: I, however, as a Christian, have a better
Messias, “so that I have no reason to fear death, being assured
of life everlasting,” etc. Well might our “heart jump for joy and
be intoxicated with mirth.” “We give thanks to the Father of
all Mercy.... It was in such joy as this that the Apostles sang
and gave praise in prison amidst all their misery, and even young
maidens, like Agatha and Lucy,” etc. But the wretched Jews
refused to acknowledge this Messias.</p>

<p>How then can one infer from Luther’s words, “I am convinced
that anyone who has felt the anguish and terror of death,” etc.,
that he represented the lot of the hog as the supreme goal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Christians in general and himself in particular? It is true that
he magnifies the fear of death which naturally must oppress the
heart of every believer, and for the moment makes no account
of the consolation of Christian hope, but all this is merely with
the object of forcing home more strongly to the Jews whom he
is addressing, what he had just said: “Of what use would all
this be to me [viz. the earthly happiness which you look for] if I
could not be sure of it even for one hour? If the horrible burden
and plague of all men, death, still presses on me, from which I
am not secure for one instant, but go in fear of it, of hell and the
wrath of God, and tremble and shiver at the prospect, and this
without any hope of its coming to an end, but continuing for all
eternity?” His closing words apply to unbelievers who are
ignorant of the salvation which is in Christ: “It is better to be a
live pig than a man who is everlastingly dying.” The passage
therefore does not convey the meaning which has been read
into it.</p></div>

<p class="p1">We may here glance at some charges in which his moral
character is involved, brought against certain doctrines and
sayings of Luther.</p>

<h4><i>Did Luther allow as valid Marriage between Brother and Sister?</i></h4>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">The statement made by some Catholics that he did can be
traced back to a misunderstanding of the simple word “dead.”
This word he wrote against several passages of a memorandum
of Spalatin’s on matrimonial questions submitted by the Elector
in 1528, for instance, against one which ran: “Further, brother
and sister may not marry, neither may a man take his brother’s
or sister’s daughter or granddaughter. And similarly it is forbidden
to marry one’s father’s, grandfather’s, mother’s or grandmother’s
sister.”<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> The word “dead” here appended does not
mean that the prohibition has ceased to hold, but is equivalent
to “delete,” and implies that the passage should be omitted in
print. Luther considered it unnecessary or undesirable that the
impediments in question should be mentioned in this “Instruction”;
he prefers that preachers should as a general rule simply
insist on compliance with the Laws of the Empire.</p>

<p>The accompanying letter of the Elector, in which he requests
Luther to read through the memorandum, anticipates such a
recommendation to omit. In it the writer asks whether “it
would perhaps be better to leave this out and to advise the
pastors and preachers of this fact in the Visitation,”<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> since, in
any case, the “Imperial Code,” in which everything was contained
in detail, was to be taken as the groundwork. Against
many clauses of the Instruction Luther places the word “<i>placet</i>”;
a “<i>non placet</i>” occurs nowhere; on the other hand, we find
frequently “<i>omittatur</i>, dead, all this dead” (i.e. “delete”);
he also says: “<i>hoc manebit, hactenus manebit textus</i>” (equivalent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
to “stet”). If “dead” had meant the same as “this impediment
no longer holds,” then Luther would here have removed
the impediment even between father and daughter, mother and
son, seeing that he writes “dead” also against the preceding
clause, which runs: “Firstly, the marriage of persons related in
the ascending and descending line is prohibited throughout and
<i>in infinitum</i>.”</p></div>

<h4><i>Did Luther Recommend People to Pray for Many Wives
and Few Children?</i></h4>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pn">This charge, too, belongs to the old armoury of well-worn
weapons beloved of controversialists. The answer to the
question may possibly afford material of some interest to the
historian and man of letters.</p>

<p>Down to quite recent times it was not unusual to find in
Catholic works a story of a poem, said to have been by Luther,
found in a MS. Bible in the Vatican Library, in which Luther
prayed that God in His Goodness would bestow “many wives
and few children.” At the present day no MS. Bible containing
a poem by Luther, or any similar German verses, exists in the
Vatican Library. What is meant, however, is a German translation
of Holy Scripture, in five volumes, dating from the fifteenth
century, which was formerly kept in the Vatican and now
belongs to the Heidelberg University library. It is one of those
Heidelberg MSS. which were brought to Rome in 1623 and
again wandered back to their old quarters in 1816 (Palat. German.
n. 19-23). The “poem” in question is at the end of vol. ii.
(cod. 20). Of it, as given by Bartsch (“Die altdeutschen Handschriften
der Universität Heidelberg”) and Wilken (“Heidelberger
Büchersammlung”),<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> we append a rough translation:</p></div>

<p class="ppn10 p1">God Almighty, Thou art good,<br />
Give us coat and mantle and hood,</p>

<p class="pc ls1">*****</p>

<p class="ppn10">Many a cow and many a ewe,<br />
<i>Plenty of wives and children few</i>.</p>

<p class="ppn8 p1">Explicit: A small wage<br />
Makes the year to seem an age.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>The “poem” has nothing whatever to do with Luther. It is a
product of the Middle Ages, met with under various forms. The
“Explicit,” too, is older than Luther and presumably was
added by the copyist of the volume. In the seventeenth century
the opinion seems to have gained ground that Luther was the
author, though no Roman scholar can be invoked as having
said so. Of the MS. Montfaucon merely says: “A very old
German Bible is worthy of notice”; Luther’s name he does
not mention.<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>One witness for the ascription of its authorship to Luther was
Max. Misson, who, in his “Nouveau voyage d’Italie,”<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> gives the
“poem” very inaccurately and states that a Bible was shown
him at the Vatican in which Luther was said to have written it,
and that the writing was the same as that of the rest of the
volume. He adds, however, that it was hardly credible that
Luther should have written such things in a Bible.</p>

<p>Later, Christian Juncker, a Protestant, relates the same thing
in his “Life of Luther,” published in 1699, but likewise expresses
a doubt. He quotes the discourse on Travels in Italy by Johann
Fabricius, the theologian of Helmstedt, where the version of the
verses differs from that given by Misson.<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a></p>

<p>According to a record of a journey to Rome undertaken in
1693, given by Johann Friedrich von Wolfframsdorf, he, too,
was shown a MS. Bible alleged to have been written by Luther,
doubtless that mentioned above.<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a></p>

<p>As a matter of fact the “poem” in question was a popular
mediæval one, frequently met with in manuscripts, sometimes
in quite inoffensive forms. At any rate, the jingling rhymes
(in the German original: Güte, Hüte, Rinder, Kinder) are the
persistent feature. According to Bartsch it occurs in the
Zimmern Chronik<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> in a version attributed to Count Hans Werdenberg
(1268), which, while retaining the same rhymes (in the
German), inverts the meaning. Here the prayer is for:</p></div>

<p class="ppn8 p1">Potent stallions, portly oxen,<br />
Buxom women, <i>plenty children</i>.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">From a MS., “<i>Gesta Romanorum</i>,” of 1476, J. L. Hocker
(“<i>Bibliotheca Heilbronnensis</i>”<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a>), quotes a similar but shorter
verse.<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> A different rendering of the poem was entered into a
Diary in 1596 by Wolff von Stechau.<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a></p>

<p>Certain Protestant writers of the present day, not content with
“saving Luther’s honour” by emphasising the fact that the
above verses of the Heidelberg MS. are not his, proceed to
insinuate that they were really “aimed at the clergy”; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
“hoods” and “hats” of which they speak were forsooth the
monks’ and the cardinals’, and the rhymester was all the time
envying the gay life of the clergy; thus the poem, so we are told,
throws a “lurid light on the esteem in which the mediæval monks
and clergy were held by the laity committed to their care.”&mdash;Yet
the verses contain no reference whatever to ecclesiastics.
“Hoods” were part of the layman’s dress and presumably
“hats,” too. And after all, would it have been so very wicked
even for a pious layman to wish to share in the good things
possessed by the clergy? If satires on the mediæval clergy are
sought for, sufficient are to be found without including this
poor jingle.</p></div>

<h4><i>Did Luther include Wives in the “Daily Bread” of the
Our Father?</i></h4>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Controversial writers have seen fit to accuse Luther of including
wives in the “daily bread” for which we ask, and, in support
of their charge, refer to his explanation of the fourth request
of the Our Father. In point of fact in the Smaller Catechism
the following is his teaching concerning this petition: It teaches
us to ask God “for everything required for the sustenance and
needs of the body, such as food, drink, clothes, shoes and house,
a farm, fields, cattle, money, goods, a <i>pious spouse,</i> pious children
and servants, and good masters, etc.<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> In the Larger Catechism
the list is similar: Food and drink, clothes, a house and farm,
health of body, grain and fruits, a pious wife, children and
servants,” etc.<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> With all this surely no fault can be found.</p></div>

<h4><i>Was Luther the originator of the proverb: “Who loves not woman,
wine and song remains a fool his whole life long”?</i></h4>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">These verses are found neither in Luther’s own writings nor
in the old notes and written traditions concerning him. Joh.
Heinrich Voss was the first to publish them in the “Wandsbeker
Bote” in 1775, reprinting them in his Musenalmanach (1777).
When he was charged by Senior Herrenschmidt with having
foisted them on to Luther, he admitted that he was unable to
give any account of their origin.<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> Several proverbs of a similar
type, dating from mediæval times, have been cited.</p>

<p>A humorous remark of Luther’s would appear, according
to Seidemann, to refer to some earlier proverb linking together
women, wine and song. The remark in question is contained in
the MS. collection of the Table-Talk preserved at Gotha and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
known as “<i>Serotina</i>,” now available in the work of E. Kroker,
published in 1903.<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a> The entire passage is not to be taken
seriously: “To-morrow I have to lecture on Noe’s drunkenness,
so to-night I shall drink deeply so as to be able to speak of the
naughty thing from experience. ‘Not at all,’ said Dr. Cordatus,
‘you must do just the opposite.’ Thereupon Luther remarked:
‘Each country must be granted its own special fault. The
Bohemians are gluttons, the Wends thieves, the Germans hard
drinkers; for my dear Cordatus, in what else does a German
excel than ‘<i>ebrietate, praesertim talem, qui non diligit musicam
et mulieres</i>’?” This saying of Luther’s, which was noted down
by Lauterbach and Weller, belongs to the year 1536.</p></div>

<h3>7. The “Good Drink”</h3>

<p>Among the imputations against Luther’s private life most
common among early controversial writers was that of
being an habitual drunkard.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many of Luther’s Protestant supporters
down to our own day have been at pains to defend
him against any charge of intemperance. Even scholarly
modern biographers of Luther pass over this point in the
most tactful silence, or with just the merest allusion, though
they delight to dwell on his “natural enjoyment of life.”</p>

<p>The following pages may help to show the failings of both
methods, of that pursued by Luther’s opponents, with their
frequently quite unjustifiable exaggerations, and of that of
his defenders with their refusal to discuss even the really
existing grounds for complaint.<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> To begin with, Luther’s
enemies must resign themselves to abandon some of the
proofs formerly adduced for his excessive addiction to
drink.</p>

<h4><i>Unsatisfactory Witnesses.</i></h4>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Luther’s saying: “If I have a can of beer, I want the beer-barrel
as well,”<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> has often been cited against him, the fact being
overlooked, that he only made use of this expression in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
illustrate, by a very common example, the idea, expressed in the
heading of the chapter in which it occurs, viz. that “No one is
ever satisfied.” Everyone, he continues, desires to go one step
higher, everyone wants to attain to something more, and, then,
with other examples, he gives that mentioned above, where, for
“I,” we might equally well substitute “we,” which indeed we
find employed elsewhere in this same connection: “If we have
one Gulden, we want a hundred.”</p>

<p>Another passage, alleged, strange to say, by older writers,
proves nothing: “We eat ourselves to death, and drink ourselves
to death; we eat and drink ourselves into poverty and
down to hell.” Here Luther is merely speaking against the habit
of drinking which had become so prevalent, and dominated some
to such an extent that death and hell were the lamentable
consequences to be feared. (See below, p. 308 f.)</p>

<p>Luther, wishing to drive a point home, says that he is not
“drunk,”<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> but is writing “in the morning hours.”<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> Must we
infer, then, that he was in the habit of writing when drunk, or
that in the afternoon he was not usually sober? Must he be
considered drunk whenever he does not state plainly that he is
sober? The truth is that such expressions were merely his way
of speaking. In the important passage here under consideration
he writes: “Possibly it may be asserted later that I did not
sufficiently weigh what I say here against those who deny the
presence of Christ in the Sacrament; but I am not drunk or
giddy; I know what I am saying and what it will mean to me
on Judgment Day and at the second coming of the Lord Jesus
Christ.”<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> Thus he is speaking most seriously and uses this
curious verbal artifice simply to emphasise his earnestness.
Were additional proof necessary it might be found in other
passages; for instance: “Christ was not drunk when He said
this,” viz. the Eucharistic words of consecration, the literal
meaning of which Luther is upholding against the Strasburg
Sacramentarians.<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a></p>

<p>For the purpose of discrediting Luther an old opponent wrote:
“The part that eating and drinking play in the life of the
Reformer is evident from his letters to his Katey,” and then
went on to refer to the perfectly innocent passage where Luther
says, that he preferred the beer and wine he was used to at home
to what he was having at Dessau, whence he wrote. The rest of
the letter has also been taken in an unnecessarily tragic sense:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
“Yesterday I had some poor stuff to drink so that I had to
begin singing: ‘If I can’t drink deep then I am sad, for a good
deep drink ever makes me so glad.’” It is quite unnecessary to
take this as a song sung by a “tipsy man”; it is simply a jesting
reference to a popular ditty which quite possibly he had actually
struck up to get rid of his annoyance at the quality of the liquor.
“You would do well,” he continues in the same jocular vein,
“to send me over the whole cellar full of my usual wine, and a
bottle of your beer as often as you can, else I shall not turn
up any more for the new brew.”<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a></p>

<p>No one who is familiar with his homely mode of speech will
take offence at his calling himself on one occasion the “corpulent
Doctor,” and in any case this involves neither gluttony nor
drunkenness. Moreover, the words occur in a serious connection,
for we shall hear it from him during the last days of his life:
“When I return again to Wittenberg I shall lay myself in my
coffin and give the worms a corpulent doctor to feast on,”<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a>
referring, of course, to his natural stoutness. Offence has also
been taken at a sentence met with in Luther’s Table-Talk, where
he says of his contemporaries of fifty years before: “How thin
they [i.e. their ranks] have become”; from which it was inferred
that he wished them a luxurious life and corpulence, and that he
“regarded pot bellies as an ornament and a thing to be desired.”
From its context, however, the meaning of the word “thin” is
clear. What Luther means is: How few of them remain in the
land of the living.</p>

<p>But does not Luther in a letter of his let fall a remark scarcely
beseeming one in his position, viz. that he would like to be more
frequently in the company of those “good fellows, the students,”
“the beer is good, the parlour-maid pretty, the lads friendly
(innig)”?<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> Such is one of the statements brought forward
against him to show his inordinate love of drink. Yet, when
examined, the letter is found to say nothing of any yearning of
Luther’s to join in the drinking-bouts of the students or of any
interest of his in the maid. “Two honest students” had been
recommended to Luther, and the letter informs its addressee,
the Mansfeld Chancellor Müller at Eisleben, of the rumour that
“too much was being consumed without any necessity by the
pair”; the Chancellor was to inform the Count of Mansfeld of the
fact in order that he (whose protégés they may have been)
“might keep an eye on them.” Then come the words: “What
harm would friendly supervision do? The beer is good, the
parlour-maid pretty and the lads young (‘jung’ not ‘innig’);
the students really behave very well, and my only regret is that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
owing to my weak health, I am unable to be oftener with them.”
This letter surely does Luther credit. It testifies to his solicitude
for the two youths committed to his care; seeing they are still
“good and pious,” he is anxious to preserve them from intemperance
and other dangers, and regrets that, owing to his
poor state of health, he is unable to have the pleasure of visiting
these young fellows more often.</p>

<p>We must also caution our readers against an alleged quotation
from Luther’s contemporary, Simon Lemnius. Lemnius is
reported to have said: “His excessive indulgence in wine and
beer made Luther at times so ill that he quite expected to die.”
No such statement occurs in the works of Lemnius. What this
writer actually did say of Luther on the score of drunkenness
will be given later. The above words are a modern invention,
though one author, strange to say, actually tacked them on
to the authentic passage in Lemnius as though they had belonged
to the latter.</p>

<p>Again, it has been said that excessive indulgence in some
Malvasian wine was, on Luther’s own admission, the cause of a
malady which troubled him for a considerable time in 1529.
Luther’s letter in question speaks, however, of a “severe and
almost fatal catarrh,” which lasted for a long time and almost
deprived him of his voice; others, too, says Luther, had suffered
from the catarrh (no great wonder in the month of March or
April), but not to the same extent as he. He had imprudently
aggravated the trouble possibly by preaching too energetically
or&mdash;and here comes the incriminating passage&mdash;“by drinking
some adulterated Malvasian to the health of Amsdorf.” Such
were his words to his confidential friend Jonas. The fact is that
a wine so expensive as Malvasian was then very liable to being
adulterated, the demand far exceeding the supply of this beverage,
which was always expected to figure on the table on great
occasions. At any rate, there is no mention here of Luther’s
illness having arisen from continuous and excessive indulgence
in wine. At the conclusion of this chapter we shall have to
consider a similar passage.</p>

<p>In the above we have examined about a dozen witnesses, whose
testimony has been shown quite valueless to prove Luther’s
alleged devotion to drink.</p>

<p>The conclusions which have been drawn from the character
of certain of Luther’s writings or utterances are also worthless.
It has been affirmed that his “Wider das Bapstum vom Teuffel
gestifft” could only have been written “under the excitement
produced by drink,” and that many of his sayings, such as his
exhortation to “pray for Our Lord God,” could have been
uttered “only by a drunken man.”</p>

<p>Yet his incredible hatred sufficed of itself to explain the frenzy
of his utterances, nor must we forget that some of his expressions,
out of place though they may seem, were chosen as best fitted
to appeal to the populace. “Pray for Our Lord God,” interpreted
in the light of other similar expressions used by him, means:
Pray for the interests of our Lord God and of the new Evangel.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Other Witnesses, Friendly and Hostile.</i></h4>

<p>Before proceeding to scrutinise in detail the more cogent
testimonies, we may remark that one trait in Luther’s
character, that namely which caused him to be called the
“merry boon companion,” might possibly be invoked in
support of the charge now under consideration.</p>

<p>It was his struggle with the gloomy moods to which he
was so prone that drove Luther into cheerful company and
to seek relief in congenial conversation and in liquor.
That he was not over-scrupulous concerning indulgence in
the latter comfort is attested by his own words, viz. that he
was too fond of jests and convivial gatherings (“<i>iocis aut
conviviis excedere</i>”), and that the world had some grounds
for taking offence (“<i>inveniat in me quo offendatur et cadat</i>”).<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a>
Yet he was very desirous of avoiding such accusations on
the part of his opponents, though, as he puts it, they
“calumniate even what is best and most inoffensive.”<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a>
When he says elsewhere in his usual gross way: “They
spy out everything that concerns me, and no sooner do I
pass a motion than they smell it at Rome,”<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> this exclamation
was called forth by the scandalous excess in drinking of
which a member of his family was habitually guilty.</p>

<p>Then, again, the drinking habits of the Germans of those
days must be borne in mind. A man had to be a very hard
drinker to gain the reputation of being a drunkard. Instances
will be given later showing how zealously Luther attacked
the vice of drunkenness in Germany. At that time a man
(even though a theologian or other person much exposed
to the gaze of the public) was free to imbibe far more
than was good for him without remarks being made or
his conduct censured.</p>

<p>Luther’s extraordinary industry and the astounding
number of his literary productions must likewise not be
lost sight of. We are compelled to ask ourselves whether
it is likely that the man who wrote works so numerous and
profound, in the midst, too, of the many other cares which
pressed on him, was addicted to habitual drunkenness.
How could the physical capacity for undertaking and
executing such immense labours, and the energy requisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
for the long, uninterrupted religious and literary struggle
into which Luther threw himself, be found in one who
unceasingly quenched an excessive thirst with alcoholic
drink? Kawerau has sketched Luther’s “colossal mental
productivity” during the one year 1529, a year in which
he was not engaged in any of his accustomed literary feuds.<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a>
Works published during that year cover, in the Weimar
edition, 287 pages, in imperial octavo, his lectures on
Deuteronomy 247 pages and the notes of his sermons (some,
however, in duplicate) 824 pages. In addition to this he
was at work on his German translation of the Old Testament,
completing the Pentateuch and making a beginning with
the remaining historical books. Besides this he wrote in
that year countless letters, of which comparatively few,
viz. 112, are still extant. He also undertook five short
journeys lasting together about a fortnight.</p>

<p>During the short and anxious period, amounting to 173
days, which he spent, in 1530, in the Castle of Coburg (it
is to this time that some of the charges of excessive
drinking refer), he wrote and forwarded to the press various
biblical expositions which in the Erlangen edition occupy
718 pages in small octavo, re-wrote in its entirety “Von den
Schlüsseln,” a work of 87 pages, was all the while busy with
his translation of Jeremias, of a portion of Ezechiel and all
the minor Prophets, and finally wrote at least the 128
letters and memoranda which are still extant.<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> Yet, for
whole days during this sojourn in the Coburg, he was plagued
with noises in the head and giddiness, results, no doubt, of
nervous excitement.</p>

<p>That such productivity would not have been possible
“without meditation and study”<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> is, however, not quite
true in his case. Luther wrote most of his works without
reflection and without any real study, merely jotting down
carelessly whatever his lively fancy suggested.</p>

<p>Thus we may rightly ask whether the accusation of
habitual participation in drinking-bouts and constant
private excess is compatible with the work he produced.</p>

<p>In the case of reports of an unfavourable nature it is of
course necessary to examine their origin carefully; this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
unfortunately is not always done. As we already had
occasion to remark when dealing with the imputations
against his moral character, it makes all the difference
whether the witness against him is a Catholic opponent or
represents the New Evangel. Amongst Catholics, again, we
must discriminate between foreigners, who were ignorant of
German customs and who sometimes wrote merely on
hearsay, and Luther’s German compatriots. We shall not
characterise the method of those of Luther’s defenders
who simply refuse to listen to his opponents on the ground
that, one and all, they are prejudiced.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Wolfgang Musculus (Mäuslin), an Evangelical theologian, in
the account of a journey in May, 1536, during which he had
visited Luther, gives an interesting and unbiassed report of
what he saw at Wittenberg.<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> On May 29, Luther came, bringing
with him Melanchthon and Lucas Cranach, to dine as Mäuslin’s
guest at the inn where he was staying. There all had their share
of the wine. “When dinner was over,” says the chronicler,
“we all went to the house of Master Lucas, the painter, where
we had another drink....<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> After this we escorted Luther
home, where we drank in true Saxon style. He was marvellously
cheerful and promised everything most readily” (i.e. probably
all that Musculus proposed concerning the agreement to be
come to with the Zwinglians, of whom Musculus was one). The
allusion to the “Saxon style” reminds us of Count Hoyer’s
reference to the “custom at Mansfeld” (vol. ii., p. 131). Luther’s
country does not seem to have been noted for its temperance.</p>

<p>Melanchthon, as one of his pupils relates in the “<i>Dicta Melanchthoniana</i>,”
tells how on a certain day in March, 1523: “Before
dinner (‘<i>ante coenam</i>’)” Luther, with two intimates, Justus
Jonas and Jacob Probst, the Pastor of Bremen, arrived at
Schweinitz near Wittenberg. Here, owing to indigestion,
“<i>cruditas</i>,” Luther was sick in a room. In order to remove the
bad impression made on the servant who had to clean the
apartment, Jonas said: “Do not be surprised, my good fellow,
the Doctor does this sort of thing every day.” By this he
certainly did not mean, as some have thought, that Luther was
in the habit of being sick every day as the result of drink; he
was merely trying to shield his friend in an embarrassing situation
by alleging a permanent illness. Pastor Probst, however,
according to Melanchthon’s story, betrayed Jonas by exclaiming:
“What a fine excuse!” Jonas thereupon seized him by the
throat and said: “Hold your tongue!” At table the pastor
was anxious to return to the matter, but Jonas was able to cut
him short. Melanchthon concludes the story with a touch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
sarcasm: “<i>Hoc est quando posteriora intelliguntur ex prioribus</i>.”
Was the sickness in this case due to previous drinking?</p>

<p>A letter, written by Luther himself, perhaps will help to
explain the matter. On the eve of his return to Wittenberg
he writes from Schweinitz on Oculi Sunday, March 8, 1523, to
his friend the Court Chaplain Spalatin, that he had come to
Schweinitz, where the Elector’s castle stood, in order to celebrate
with the father the baptism of the son of a convert Jew named
Bernard. “We drank good, pure wine from the Elector’s
cellar,” he says; “we should indeed be grand Evangelicals if
we feasted to the same extent on the Evangel.... Please
excuse us to the Prince for having drunk so much of his Grüneberger
wine (‘<i>quod tantum vini Gornbergici ligurierimus</i>’).
Jonas and his wife greet you, also the godfathers, godmothers
and myself; three virgins were present, certainly Jonas, for,
as he has no child, we call him a virgin.”<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> The letter, curiously
disconnected and containing such strange jests, quite gives the
impression of having been written after such a festive gathering
as that described by the writer.</p>

<p>In connection with Melanchthon’s story some Protestants
have recently urged that, in 1523, Luther was subject to attacks
of “sudden indisposition” which came on him in the morning
and from which he found relief in vomiting, and that the above
incident is explained by this circumstance; the fact that he was
sick “before the meal and after a lengthy drive proves that we
have to do with a result not of intemperance but of nervous
irritation.” Of such “sudden indispositions” arising from
nervousness we, however, hear nothing, either during that year
or for long after. None of the sources mention anything of the
kind. On the contrary, at Whitsun, 1523, Luther wrote to
Nicholas Hausmann that he felt “fairly well” (“<i>satis bene
valeo</i>”); that he was of a nervous temperament is of course true,
but that the morning hours were, as a rule, his worst we only
begin to learn from his letters in 1530 and 1532; there, moreover,
he does not mention sickness, but merely “giddiness and the
attacks of Satan,” which were wont to come on him before
breakfast, (“<i>prandium</i>,”<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> a meal taken about 9 or 10 a.m.).
Melanchthon’s story speaks, however, not of the morning at all,
but of the time before the “<i>coena</i>” (i.e. the principal meal,
taken about 5 p.m.), when Luther was presumably no longer
fasting.</p>

<p>Still, it would be better not to lay too much stress on this
isolated particular incident.<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a></p>

<p>Next in the series of statements coming from preachers of the
new Evangel, we meet that of Johann Agricola, who, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
to Thiele, in the recently discovered notes of his (above, p. 216),
when he had already separated from Luther, represents him as
a “drunken profligate,” “who gave the rein to his passions and
whom only his wife’s sway could influence for good.” Agricola
says that Luther had contemptuously put aside certain letters
of his, but “at last read them one morning before the wine had
mounted to his head (‘<i>mane, nondum vino calefactus</i>’). Then
he showed himself willing to take me into favour again”; this
being the result of Katey’s intercession.</p>

<p>After this we have the testimony of the Swiss theologian, Leo
Judæ, who, as Kolde tells us,<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> in the letter to Bucer quoted
above (p. 277) and dated April 24, 1534, “reproaches Luther
with drunkenness and all manner of things, and declares that
such a bishop he would not tolerate even in the tiniest diocese.”</p>

<p>Valentine Ickelsamer, in 1525, voices the “fanatics,” whom
Luther was attacking so vigorously, in his complaint, that the
latter was “careless and heedless amidst all our needs, and
spent his time in utter unconcern with the beer-swillers”; before
this he had already said: “I am well acquainted with your
behaviour, having been for a while a student at Wittenberg; I
will, however, say nothing of your gold finger-ring, which gives
scandal to so many people, or of the pleasant room overlooking
the water where you drink and make merry with the other
doctors and gentlemen.”<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> Neither Ickelsamer nor his friends
formulate against Luther any explicit charge of startling or
habitual excess. His daily habits, as just depicted, seemed to
them to be at variance with his claim to being a divinely appointed
preacher, called to raise mankind to higher things, but this was
chiefly on account of their own peculiar narrow mysticism. It
was from the same standpoint that, wishing to absolve himself
from the charge of “inciting to rebellion,” Thomas Münzer, in
1524, writes in his “Schutzrede”<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> against the “witless, wanton
lump of flesh at Wittenberg,” also twitting Luther with his
“luxurious living” (vol. ii., p. 131), i.e. the daintiness of his
food.</p>

<p>With regard to Simon Lemnius, it will suffice to refer to the
passage already adduced (p. 274): “Luther boasts of being
an evangelical bishop; how then comes it that he lives so far
from temperately, being wont to surfeit himself with food and
drink?” It is unnecessary to repeat how much caution must
be exercised in appealing to this writer’s statements.</p>

<p>Among Catholic critics the first place is taken by the theologian,
Ambrosius Catharinus, an Italian who lived far from Germany.
His statement regarding Luther’s dancing and drinking has
already been given (p. 276). This, together with many other of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
his strictures<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> on Luther’s teaching and work, were collected by
Cochlæus. Catharinus was present at the Council of Trent from
1546-1547 and such reports as these may there have reached
his ears. That Luther danced, or as Catharinus says, even led
the dances, is not vouched for in any source. Only concerning
Melanchthon have we a credible report, that he “sometimes
danced.” On the other hand, we do know that Luther was
frequently present at balls, weddings, christenings and other
such occasions when food and drink were to be had in plenty. So
distinguished and pleasant a guest was naturally much in
demand, as Luther himself tells us on several occasions.</p>

<p>Luther’s letter to Spalatin, on January 14, 1524, concerning
the (real or imaginary) agent sent by King Ferdinand to enquire
into his life at Wittenberg, also speaks of the report carried to
Court of his intercourse with women and habits of drunkenness
(vol. ii., p. 132 f.).</p>

<p>Shortly before, in 1522, Count Hoyer of Mansfeld, a Catholic,
wrote in a letter to Count Ulrich of Helfenstein, brought to light
by a Protestant historian, “that Luther was a thorough scoundrel,
who drank deeply, as was the custom at Mansfeld, played the lute,
etc.” (vol. ii., p. 131). If, as we find recounted elsewhere, Luther,
on his journey to the Diet, and at Worms itself, partook freely
of the costly wines in which his enthusiastic friends pledged him,
this was, after all, no great crime. It is probable, however, that
some worse tales to Luther’s discredit in this matter of drinking
had come to Hoyer’s ear.</p>

<p>At the time of the Diet of Worms, Aleander, the Papal Legate
there present, indeed writes that Luther was “addicted to
drunkenness,”<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> but the credulous diplomat probably trusted to
what he heard from parties hostile to Luther and little acquainted
with him. (See vol. ii., p. 78 f.) It is also a fact that, to Italians
imbued with the idea that the Germans were drunkards, even
quite moderate drinking might seem scandalous.</p>

<p>Cochlæus says of Luther in 1524: “According to what I hear,
in his excessive indulgence in beer, Luther is worse than a
debauchee.”<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> Here again we have merely an echo of statements
made by strangers, albeit in this instance stronger and more
positive.&mdash;Less weight is to be attached to the account of Jacob
Ziegler of Landau, who writes from Rome to Erasmus on
February 16, 1522, that there Luther was regarded as “given to
fornication and tippling,” adding that he was considered as the
precursor of Antichrist.<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a>&mdash;Of the inhabitants of Wittenberg
generally Ulrich Zasius complains, in a letter of December 21,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
1521, to Thomas Blaurer, that it was reported they ran almost
daily to communion but afterwards swilled beer to such an extent
that they were unable to recognise each other.<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> To his other
charges against the life led there and against the heads of the
movement, Blaurer replied, but, curiously enough, the complaint
of drunkenness he does not even refer to.<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> From the detailed
description given by a Catholic Canon of Wittenberg on December
29, 1521, we do, however, learn that the greatest abuses
prevailed in connection with the Supper, and that some even
communicated who had previously been indulging in brandy.<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a></p>

<p>The last witness had nothing to say of Luther personally. On
the other hand, another does state that, the night before his death,
he was “<i>plane obrutus potu</i>.” This, however, comes from a
later writer, who lived far away and has shown himself otherwise
untrustworthy.<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a></p>

<p>Another less unreliable report also has to do with Luther’s
death-bed. Johann Landau, the Mansfeld apothecary, who was
a Catholic, and had occasion to handle Luther’s corpse, left the
following in the notes he made: “In consequence of excessive
eating and drinking the body was full of corrupt juices,” Luther
had “exceeded in the use of sweet foreign wines.” “It is said,”
he continues, “that he drank every day at noon and in the
evening a sextar of rich foreign wine.”<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> This statement does not
appear to be restricted to the last days of Luther’s life, which
were spent with Count Mansfeld. It is well known that Luther
died after a meal. What amount the “sextar” and the “stuebchen,”
to be mentioned immediately, represented has not yet
been determined, as the measures differed so much in various
parts of the country. The sextar, according to G. Agricola, was
usually a quarter of the stuebchen, as, according to him, twenty-four
sextars or six stuebchen went to one amphora; the sextar
itself contained four gills.<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> In a letter of Luther’s, dating from
the period of his stay at Mansfeld, we find the following: “We
live well here,” he writes to Katey, “and the council allows me
for each meal half a gallon of excellent Rheinfall. Sometimes I
drink it with my companions. The wine produced here is also
good and the Naumburg beer quite capital.”<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a> Rheinfall (more
correctly Reinfal) was a southern wine then highly prized.<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a>
Luther, as a rule, preferred to keep to Naumburg beer.<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Luther’s Own Comments on the “Good Drink.”</i></h4>

<p>The following statements of Luther’s concerning his
indulgence in spirituous liquors are especially noteworthy;
of these some have been quoted without sufficient attention
being paid to their real meaning.</p>

<p>“Know that all goes well with me here,” Luther writes
in 1540 from Weimar to his Katey, who was anxious about
him; “I feed like a Bohemian, and swill like a German,
for which God be thanked, Amen.”<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> Soon after he repeats,
in a letter to the same addressee, the phrase which has since
grown famous, this time in a slightly amended form:
Know “that we are well and cheerful here, thanks be to
God; we feed like Bohemians, though not too much, and
swill like Germans, not deeply but with jollity.”<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> He is
fond of thus speaking of his “feeding and swilling,” though,
such expressions being less unconventional then than now,
stress must not be laid on them. In both letters he was
clearly seeking by his jests to reassure his wife, who was
concerned for his health. During his last weeks at Eisleben
he also wrote to Katey: “We have plenty on which to feed
and swill.”<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a></p>

<p>“If the Lord God holds me excused,” he says in a famous
utterance in the Table-Talk, “for having plagued Him for
quite twenty years by celebrating Mass, He assuredly will
excuse me for sometimes indulging in a drink to His
honour; God grant it and let the world take it as it will.”<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a></p>

<p>Of the last decade of Luther’s life his pupil Mathesius
relates, that, in the evening, “if not inclined for sleep, he
had to take a draught to promote it, often making excuse
for so doing: ‘You young fellows must not mind if our
Elector and an old chap like me take a generous drink; we
have to try and find our pillow and our bolster in the
tankard.’”<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> The same witness relates another utterance of
about the same time: “He came home from a party and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
drank the health of a guest: ‘I must make merry to-day,
for I have received bad tidings; for this there is no better
cure than a fervent Paternoster and a brave heart. For
the demon of melancholy is much put out when a man
insists upon being merry.’”<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a></p>

<p>Here we have two reasons, want of sleep and depression
resulting from bad news, which induced him to have a
“good drink.” A third reason was furnished by his temptations
to doubt and vacillate in faith. The “good drink”
must not, however, be too deep as it “recently was at the
Electoral couchee at Torgau, where, not satisfied with the
usual measures, they pledged each other in half-gallon cans.
That they called a good drink. <i>Sic inventa lege inventa
est et fraus legis.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a></p>

<p>Luther’s advice to his pupil Hieronymus Weller, when the
latter was tempted and troubled, as stated above (p. 175),
was to follow his example and “to drink deeper and jest more
freely,” and to answer the devil when he objected to such
drinking, that “he would drink all the more because he
forbade it”; he himself (Luther), for no other reason, was
wont to drink more deeply and talk more freely than to
scorn the devil by his “hard drinking.”<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> “When troubled
with gloomy thoughts,” he declared on another occasion,
it was his habit “to have a good pull at the beer”; Melanchthon
had a different sort of remedy, viz. consulting
the stars; Luther, however, considered his practice the
better one.<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a></p>

<p>These and such-like utterances circulated far and wide,
often in a highly exaggerated form, and Luther had only
himself to thank if many Catholics, on the strength of them,
came to regard him as a regular drunkard. This impression
was in no way diminished by the rough humour which
accompanied his talk of eating and drinking. People then
were perfectly acquainted with the fact that the Table-Talk
was regarded, even by some enthusiastic Lutherans, as only
a half revelation, the truth being that they did not make
sufficient allowance for Luther’s vein of humour and
exaggeration.</p>

<p>It was, however, quite seriously that Luther spoke in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
August, 1540, when the excessive drinking of the miners
was discussed at table: “It is not well,” he said, “but if
they work hard for the rest of the week, then we must allow
them some relaxation (at the week-end). Their work is
hard and very dangerous and some allowance must be made
for the custom of the country. I, too, have an occasional
tipple, but not everybody must follow my example, for not
all have the work to do that I have.”<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> Here, accordingly,
we have a fourth reason alleged in excuse of his drinking,
possibly the most usual and practical one, viz. his fatiguing
work.&mdash;In May of the same year he expressed his opinion
of the extent to which drinking might be allowable in
certain circles; this he did because he had been accused of
not reproving drunkenness at the Court: “On the contrary,”
he says, “I have spoken strongly about it before
the whole Court; truly I spoke forcibly and severely to the
nobles, reproaching them with tempting and corrupting the
Prince. This greatly pleased the old gentleman [the Elector
Johann], for he lived temperately.... I said to the nobles:
‘You ought to employ yourselves after dinner in the
Palæstra or in some other good exercise, after which you
might have a good drink, for drinking is permissible, but
drunkenness never (<i>ebrietas est ferenda, sed ebriositas
minime</i>).’”<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> “Cheerful people,” he said in May or June,
“may sometimes indulge more freely in wine,” but if
drinking makes a man angry, he must avoid it like “poison.”
These words were meant for his nephew, Hans Polner, who
was in the habit of returning to Luther’s house much the
worse for drink. With him Luther was very wroth: “On
your account I am ill-spoken of by foreigners. My foes
spy out everything that goes on about me.... When you
do some mischief while drunk, you forget what shame you
are bringing not only upon me and on my house, but on the
town, the Church and the Evangel. Others after a drinking-bout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
are merry and friendly; such was the case with my
father; they simply sing and jest; but you, you fly into a
rage.”<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a></p>

<p>Luther, when preaching to the people, often denounced
the prevalent habit of drinking, a circumstance which must
not be overlooked when passing judgment upon him. The
German vice of drunkenness which he saw increasing around
him in the most alarming manner caused him such distress,
that he exclaimed in one of his postils: “Our poor German
land is chastised and plagued with this devil of drink, and
altogether drowned in this vice, so that life and limb,
possessions and honour, are shamefully lost while people
lead the life of swine, so that, had we to depict Germany, we
should have to show it under the image of a sow.”<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> Only
“the little children, virgins and women” were exempt from
the malady; “unless God strikes at this vice by a national
calamity everything will go down to the abyss, all sodden
through and through with drink.”<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> Was this the way to be
grateful “to the light of the Evangel” which had burst
upon Germany?<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> His question shows that he was speaking
primarily of the conditions prevailing under the new Evangel.
Looking back on the Catholic past he has perforce to admit,
that, although this vice was by no means unknown then, yet
“I remember that when I was young it [drunkenness] was
looked upon by the nobility as a great shame, and that worthy
gentry and Princes sought to combat it by wise prohibitions
and penalties; but now it is even worse and more prevalent
amongst them than amongst the peasants; so far has it
come that even Princes and men of gentle birth learn it
from their squires, and are not ashamed of it; it is regarded
as honourable and quite a virtue by Princes, nobles and
burghers, so that whosoever refuses to become a sodden
brute is despised.”<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a></p>

<p>In powerful passages such as these he assails the vice
from both the natural and the supernatural standpoint.
Yet his chief complaint is not so much its existence as its
appalling extent; his reproofs are intended for those who
“get drunk daily,” for those “maddened and sodden with
drink,” for those who “day and night are ever pouring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
liquor down their throats.” He expressly states that he is
willing to be lenient in cases where a man is drunk only now
and again. “It may be borne with and overlooked,” he
says in the sermon quoted, “if from time to time a person
by mistake takes a glass too much, or, after being exhausted
by labour and toil, gets a little the worse for drink.”<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a></p>

<p>In 1534, in an exposition of Psalm ci., where he describes
the doings of the “Secular Estate,” he is no less hopeless
concerning this plague which afflicts Germany: “Every
country must have its own devil; our German devil is a
good skin of wine and surely his name is Swill”; until the
last day eternal thirst would remain the German’s curse;
it was quite useless to seek to remedy matters, Swill still
remained the all-powerful god.<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> More dignified language
would assuredly have been better in place here and elsewhere
where he deals with this subject. For quaint homeliness
it would, however, be hard to beat him; referring to
their drinking habits, he tells the great men at the Court:
“In the morning you really look as though your heads had
been pickled in brine.”<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> Yet, from the very passage in the
Table-Talk where this is recounted, we learn that he said
to the guests, again in a far too indulgent strain: “The Lord
God must account the drunkenness of us Germans a mere
daily [i.e. venial] sin, for we are unable to give it up; nevertheless,
it is a shameful curse, harmful alike to body, soul
and property.”</p>

<h4><i>Witnesses to Luther’s Temperate Habits.</i></h4>

<p>Within Luther’s camp the chief witnesses to his temperate
habits are Melanchthon and Mathesius.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Melanchthon in his formal panegyric on the deceased says,
that “though a stout man, he was very moderate in eating and
drinking (‘<i>natura valde modici cibi et potus</i>’). I have seen him,
when quite in good health, abstaining entirely from food and
drink for four days. At other times I frequently saw him content
himself for many days with a little bread with kippers.”<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a> His
four days’ abstinence, however, probably coincided with one of
his attacks&mdash;“temptations,” which, as we know from Ratzeberger,
his medical adviser, were usually accompanied by
intense dislike for food. Besides, before his marriage, Luther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
had not the same attention and care he received later from his
wife. It is not unlikely that Melanchthon was thinking of this
period when he speaks of the “bread and kippers,” for the
passage really refers to the beginning of his acquaintanceship
with Luther, possibly even to his monastic days. However this
may be, we must not forget that the clause is part of a panegyric.</p>

<p>Mathesius, Luther’s attentive pupil and admirer, says of him
in his sermons, that Luther, “although he was somewhat
corpulent, ate and drank little and rarely anything out of the
common, but contented himself with ordinary food. In the
evening, if not inclined to sleep, he had to take a draught to
promote it, often making excuse for so doing.”<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">That Luther was perfectly content “without anything
out of the common” is confirmed by other writers, and
concerning the general frugality of his household there can
be no question. In this respect we may well believe what
Mathesius says, for he was a regular attendant at Luther’s
evening table in the forties of the century. His assertion
that Luther “drank but little” must, however, be considered
in the light of other of his statements.</p>

<p>What Mathesius thought of the “sleeping-draught” and
the feasts at which, so he relates, Luther assisted from
time to time, appears from a discourse incorporated by him
in his “Wedding-sermons.” Here he speaks of the “noble
juice of the grape and how we can make use of it in a godly
fashion and with a good conscience”; he is simply the
mouthpiece of Luther. Like Luther, he condemns gluttony
and “bestial drunkenness,” but is so indulgent in the
matter of cheerful carousing that a Protestant Canon in the
eighteenth century declared, that Mathesius had gone
astray in his sermon on the use of wine.<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a> Mathesius says
that we must have “a certain amount of patience” with
those who sometimes, for some quite valid reason, “get a
little tipsy,” or “kick over the traces,” provided they
“don’t do so every day” and that “the next morning they
are heartily sorry for it”; the learned were quite right in
distinguishing between “<i>ebriositas</i>” and “<i>ebrietas</i>”; if a
ruling Prince had worked industriously all day, or a scholar
had “read and studied till his head swam,” such busy and
much-tired people, if they chose “in the evening to drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
away their cares and heavy thoughts, must be permitted
some over-indulgence, particularly if it does not hinder them
in the morning from praying, studying and working.”<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a></p>

<p>This is the exact counterpart of Luther’s theory and
practice as already described, in the distinction made
between “<i>ebriositas</i>” and “<i>ebrietas</i>,” in the statement that
drunkenness is no more than a venial sin, in the unseemly
and jocose tone employed when speaking of tipsiness, and
in the license accorded those who (like Luther) had much
work to do, or (again, like Luther), were plagued with
“gloomy thoughts.” The other conditions are also noteworthy,
viz. that it must not be of “daily occurrence” and
that the offender must afterwards be “heartily sorry”;
in such a case we must be tolerant. All this agrees with
Luther’s own teaching.</p>

<p>Such passages, coming from the master and his devoted
disciple, must be taken as the foundation on which to base
our judgment. Such general statements of principle must
carry more weight than isolated instances of Luther’s actual
practice, more even than the various testimonies considered
above. In the eyes of the impartial historian, moreover,
the various elements will be seen to fit into each other
so as to form a whole, the elements being on the one hand
the highly questionable principle we have just heard
expressed, and on the other his own admissions concerning
his practice, supplemented by the testimony of outsiders.</p>

<p>In the first place, there is no doubt that his theory was
dangerously lax. We need only call to mind the string of
reasons given in vindication of a “good drink” and mere
“<i>ebrietas</i>.” Such excuses were not only insufficient but
might easily be adduced daily in ever-increasing number.
Luther’s limitation of the permission to occasional bouts,
etc., was altogether illusory and constituted no real barrier
against excess. How could such theories, we may well ask,
promote temperance and self-denial? Instead of resisting
the lower impulses of nature they give the reins to license.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
They are part and parcel of the phenomenon so noticeable
in early Lutheranism, where Christian endeavour, owing
to the discredit with which penance and good works were
overwhelmed, was not allowed to rise above the level of
ordinary life, and indeed often failed to attain even to this
standard. How different sound the injunctions of Christ
and His Apostles to the devoted followers of the true
Gospel: Take up thy cross; resist the flesh and all its lusts;
be sober and watch.</p>

<p>The result as regards Luther’s practice must on the whole
be considered as unfavourable, though it is not of course
so well known to us as his theory. It may also, quite possibly,
have varied at different periods of his life, for instance,
may not have been the same when Mathesius was acquainted
with him, i.e. when his mode of life had become more
regular, as when Count Hoyer of Mansfeld wrote so scornfully
after the Diet of Worms. Nevertheless, Luther’s
vigorous denunciation of habitual drunkenness on the one
hand, and the extraordinary amount of work he contrived
to get through on the other, also the absence of any very
damaging or definite charge by those who had every opportunity
of observing him at Wittenberg, for instance, the
hostile Anabaptists and other “sectarians,” all this leads
us to infer, that he availed himself of his theories only to
a very limited extent. His own statements, however, as
well as those of his friends and opponents, enable us to see
that his lax principle, “<i>ebrietas est ferenda</i>,” was not without
its effects upon his habits of life. The allegation of his
joy of living, and his healthy love of the things of sense,
does not avail to explain away his own admissions, nor
what others laid to his charge. The worst of it is, that we
gain the impression that the lax theory was conceived to
suit his own case, for all the reasons which he held to excuse
the “good drink” and the subsequent “<i>ebrietas</i>” were
present in his case&mdash;depression caused by bad news, cares
and gloomy thoughts, pressure of work, temptations to
sadness and doubts, sleeplessness and mental exhaustion.</p>

<h4><i>From the Cellar and the Tap-Room.</i></h4>

<p>The task remains of considering certain further traits in
Luther’s life with regard to his indulgence in drinking.</p>

<p>During the first part of his public career Luther himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
speaks of the temptation to excessive eating and drinking
and other bad habits to which he was exposed. This he did
in 1519 in his remarkably frank confession to his superior
Staupitz.<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> Here the expression “<i>crapula</i>” must be taken
more seriously than on another occasion when, in a letter to
a friend written from the Wartburg in the midst of his
arduous labours, he describes himself as “sitting idle, and
‘<i>crapulosus</i>.’”<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a></p>

<p>After Luther’s marriage, when he had settled down
comfortably in the Black Monastery, it was Catherine, who,
agreeably with the then custom, brewed the beer at home.
It seems, however, to have been of inferior quality, indeed not
fit to set before his guests. That he had several sorts of
wine in his cellar we learn on the occasion of the marriage
of his niece Lena in 1538. He complains that in Germany
it was very hard to buy “a really trustworthy drink,” as
even the carriers adulterated the wines on the way.<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a></p>

<p>As already stated, beer was his usual drink. Whilst he
was “drinking Wittenberg beer with Philip and Amsdorf,”
he said as early as 1522, in a well-known passage, “the
Papacy had been weakened through the Word of God”
which he had preached.<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a></p>

<p>It was, however, with wine that on great occasions the
ample “Catechismusglas” (see above, p. 219) was filled.<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a>
How much this bowl contained which Luther, though not
his guest Agricola, could empty at one draught, has not
been determined, though illustrations of it were thought to
exist. Agricola’s statement concerning his vain attempt
to drain it leads us to conclude that the famous glass was
of considerable size. It impresses one strangely to learn
that Luther occasionally toasted his guests in a crystal beaker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
reputed to have once belonged to St. Elizabeth of Hungary;
this too, no doubt, passed from hand to hand.<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a></p>

<p>An example of Luther’s accustomed outspokenness was
witnessed by some of those who happened to be present on
the arrival of a Christmas gift of wine in 1538. The cask
came from the Margrave of Brandenburg and, to the intense
disappointment of the recipient, contained Franconian wine.
Luther, in spite of the importance of the gift, made no
secret of his annoyance, and his complaints would appear
to have duly reached the ear of the Margrave. In order
to efface the bad impression made at Court, Luther was
obliged to send a letter of excuse to Sebastian Heller, the
Chancellor. Therein he says he had been quite unaware of
the excellence of Franconian wine, and, “like the big fool”
he was, had not known that the inhabitants of Franconia
were so fortunate in their wine as now, after tasting it, he
had ascertained to be the case. In future he was going to
stick to Franconian wine; to the Prince he sent his best
thanks and trusted he would take nothing amiss.<a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a>&mdash;From
the Landgrave Philip of Hesse, after he had forwarded him
his memorandum regarding his bigamy, he received a
hogshead of Rhine wine.<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> In the same year he received
from the Town Council of Wittenberg a present of a gallon
of Franconian “and four quarts of Gutterbogk wine” on
the occasion of the marriage of his niece, mentioned above.</p>

<p>From the magistrates, in addition to other presents,
came frequent gifts of liquor for himself and his guests, of
which we find the entries since 1519 recorded in the Town-registers.</p>

<p>Only recently has attention been drawn to this.<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a></p>

<p>In 1525 we find the following items: “7 Gulden for six
cans of Franconian wine at 14 Groschen the quart presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
<i>Doctori Martino</i> on his engagement; 136 Gulden, 6 Groschen
for a barrel of Einbeck beer presented <i>Doctori Martino</i>
for his wedding; 440 Gulden <i>Doctori Martino</i> for wine
and beer presented by the Council and the town on the
occasion of his nuptials and wedding. Fine of 120 Gulden
paid by Clara, wedded wife of Lorenz Eberhard dwelling
at Jessen for abusive language concerning Doctor Martin
and his honourable wife, and also for abusing the Pastor’s
[Bugenhagen] wife at Master Lubeck’s wedding; 136
Gulden, 2 Groschen for wine sent for during the year by
Doctor Martin from the town vaults and paid for by the
Council.” In addition to the various “presents” made by
the Council, we meet repeatedly in other years with items
recording deliveries of beer or wine which Luther had sent
for from the town cellar. These are entered as “owing....
The Council loath to sue him for them....” And again,
“allowed to Doctor Martin this year....”</p>

<p>This explains the low items for liquor in Luther’s own list of
household expenses, which were frequently quoted in proof of
his exceptional abstemiousness. As a matter of fact, they are
so small simply owing to the presents and to his requisitions
on the town cellars, for much of which he never paid. “Four
pfennigs daily for drink” we read in his household accounts
in a Gotha MS., the date of which is uncertain.<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> Seeing that
at Wittenberg a can of beer cost 3 pfennigs, this would
allow him very little. According to another entry Katey
required 56 pfennigs weekly for making the beer; the
date of this is equally uncertain. It is to the filial
devotion of Protestant researchers that we owe this
information.<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a></p>

<p>Luther was in a particularly cheerful mood when he wrote,
on March 18, 1535, the letter, already quoted (p. 296 f.), to
his friend Caspar Müller, the Mansfeld Chancellor at Eisleben.
The letter is to some extent a humorous one, but is it really
a fact that in the last of the three signatures appended he
qualifies himself as “<i>Doctor plenus</i>”?<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> According to some
controversialists such is the case.</p>

<p>It is true that Denifle says of this signature, now-preserved
with the letter in the Vatican Library,<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> “that the badly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
written and scarcely legible word ... either reads or might
be read as ‘<i>plenus</i>.’”<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> According to R. Reitzenstein, on the
other hand, who also studied them, the characters cannot
possibly be read thus. E. Thiele, who mentions this, suggests<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a>
that perhaps we might read it as “Doctor Hans,”
and that the signature in question might refer to Luther’s
little son who was with him and whose greetings with those
of the mother Luther sends at the end of the letter to
Müller, who was the child’s godfather.</p>

<p>First comes the legible signature “<i>Doctor Martinus</i>” in
Luther’s handwriting; below this, also quite legible, stands
“<i>Doctor Luther</i>,” possibly denoting his wife, as Thiele
very reasonably conjectures; finally we have the questionable
“<i>Doctor plenus</i>.” To read “Hans” instead of
“<i>plenus</i>,” is, according to Denifle, “quite out of the
question,” as I also found when I came to examine the
facsimile published by G. Evers in 1883.<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> On the other
hand, to judge by the facsimile, it appeared to me that
“<i>Johannes</i>” might possibly be the true reading, and the
Latin form also seemed to agree with that of the previous
signatures. When I was able to examine the original in
Rome in May, 1907, I convinced myself that, as a matter
of fact, the badly formed and intertwined characters could
be read as “<i>Johannes</i>”; this reading was also confirmed
by Alfredo Monaci, the palæologist.<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> Hence the reading
“<i>Doctor plenus</i>,” too confidently introduced by Evers and
repeated by Enders, though with a query, in his edition of
Luther’s letters, may safely be consigned to oblivion. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
had it been correct, it would merely have afforded a fresh
example of Luther’s jokes at his own expense, and would
not necessarily have proved that his mirth was due to
spirituous influence.</p>

<p>In one letter of Luther’s, which speaks of the time he
passed in the Castle of Coburg, we hear more of the disagreeable
than of the cheering effects of wine.</p>

<p>“I have brought on headache by drinking old wine in the
Coburg,” he complains to his friend Wenceslaus Link, “and
this our Wittenberg beer has not yet cured. I work little
and am forced to be idle against my will because my head
must have a rest.”<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> In the Electoral accounts 25 Eimer of
wine are set down for the period of Luther’s stay at the
Coburg;<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> seeing that he and two companions spent only
173 days there, our Protestant friends have hastened to
allege “the frequent visits he received” in the Coburg.<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a>
It is true that he had a good many visitors during the latter
part of his stay. However this may be, the illness showed
itself as early as May, 1530. His own diagnosis here is no
less unsatisfactory than the accounts concerning the other
maladies from which he suffered. No doubt the malady
was chiefly nervous.</p>

<p>In October of that same year, Luther protested that he
had been “very abstemious in all things”<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> at the Coburg,
and Veit Dietrich, his assistant at that time, wrote in the
same sense on July 4: “I carefully observed that he did
not transgress any of the rules of diet.”<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> His indisposition
showed itself in unbearable noises in the head, at times
accompanied by extreme sensitiveness to light.<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> Luther
was convinced that the trouble was due to the qualities of
the strong wines provided for him at the castle&mdash;or, possibly,
to the devil. “We are very well off,” he says in June, 1530,
“and live finely, but for almost a month past I have been
plagued not only with noises but with actual thundering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
in my head, due, perhaps, to the wine, perhaps to the
malice of Satan.”<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> Veit Dietrich inclined strongly to the
latter view. He tells us of the apparition of a “flaming
fiery serpent” under which form the devil had manifested
himself to Luther during his solitude in the Coburg: “On
the following day he was plagued with troublesome noises
in his head; thus the greater part of what he suffered was
the work of the devil.”<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> Luther himself complained in August
of a fresh indisposition, this time scarcely due to nerves,
which, according to him, was the result either of wine, or
of the devil. “I am troubled with a sore throat, such as I
never had before; possibly the strong wine has increased
the inflammation, or perhaps it is a buffet of Satan [2 Cor.
xii. 7].”<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> Four days later he wrote again: “My head still
buzzes and my throat is worse than ever.”<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> In the following
month some improvement showed itself, and even before
this he had days free from suffering; still, after quitting
the Coburg, he still complained of incessant headache
caused, as he thought, by the “old wine.” When all is said,
however, it does seem that later controversialists were wrong
in so confidently attributing his illness in the Coburg merely
to excessive love of the bottle.</p>

<p>Luther often vaunted the wholesome effects of beer. In
a letter to Katey dated February 1, 1546, he extols the
aperient qualities of Naumburg beer.<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a> In another to Jonas,
dated May 15, 1542, he speaks of the good that beer had
done in relieving his sufferings from stone; beer was to be
preferred to wine; much benefit was also to be derived from
a strict diet.<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a></p>

<p>All these traits from Luther’s private life, taken as a
whole, may be considered to confirm the opinion expressed
above, p. 311 f., regarding the charges which may stand
against him and those of which he is to be acquitted.</p>

<p class="pc2 mid">LUTHER AND MELANCHTHON</p>


<h3>1. Melanchthon in the Service of Lutheranism, 1518-30</h3>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">When</span> Melanchthon was called upon to represent Lutheranism
officially at the Diet of Augsburg, while the real head of
the innovation remained in the seclusion of the Coburg (vol.
ii., p. 384), he had already been in the closest spiritual
relation with Luther for twelve years.</p>

<p>The talented young man who had given promise of the
highest achievements in the domain of humanism, and who
had taken up his residence at Wittenberg with the intention
of devoting his academic career more particularly to the
Greek classics, soon fell under Luther’s influence. Luther
not only loved and admired him, but was, all along, determined
to exploit, in the interests of his new theology, the
rare gifts of a friend and colleague thirteen years his junior.
Melanchthon not only taught the classics, but, after a
while, announced a series of lectures on the Epistle to Titus.
It was due to Luther that he thus gave himself up more
to divinity and eventually cultivated it side by side with
humanism. “With all his might” Luther “drove him to
study theology.”<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a> Melanchthon’s “<i>Loci communes</i>” or
elements of theology, a scholastically conceived work on
the main doctrines of Lutheranism, was one of the results
of Luther’s efforts to profit by the excellent gifts of the
colleague&mdash;who he was convinced had been sent him by
Providence&mdash;in formulating his theology and in demolishing
the olden doctrine of the Church. The “<i>Loci</i>” proved to be
a work of fundamental importance for Luther’s cause.<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a></p>

<p>The character of the “<i>Loci</i>,” at once methodic and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
positive, indicated the lines on which Melanchthon as a
theologian was afterwards to proceed. He invented nothing,
his aim being rather to clothe Luther’s ideas in clear, comprehensive
and scholastic language&mdash;so far as this could be
done. His carefully chosen wording, together with his
natural dislike for exaggeration or unnecessary harshness
of expression, helped him in many instances so to tone down
what was offensive in Luther’s doctrines and opinions as
to render them, in their humanistic dress, quite acceptable
to many scholars. As a matter of fact, however, all his
polish and graceful rhetoric often merely served to conceal
the lack of ideas, or the contradictions. The great name he
had won for himself in the field of humanism by his numerous
publications, which vied with those of Reuchlin and
Erasmus&mdash;his friends called him “<i>praeceptor Germaniae</i>”&mdash;went
to enhance the importance of his theological works
amongst those who either sided with Luther or were
wavering.</p>

<h4><i>Earlier Relations of Luther with Melanchthon.</i></h4>

<p>As professor, Melanchthon had at the outset an audience
of from five to six hundred, and, later, his hearers numbered
as many as 1500. He was perfectly aware that this was
due to the renown which the University of Wittenberg had
acquired through Luther, and the success of their common
enterprise bound him still more closely to the ecclesiastical
innovation. To the very end of his life he laboured in the
interests of Lutheranism in the lecture-hall, at religious
disputations, by his printed works, his memoranda, and his
letters, by gaining new friends and by acting as intermediary
when dissension threatened.&mdash;In his translation
of the Bible Luther found a most willing and helpful
adviser in this expert linguist. It is worthy of note that he
never took the degree of Doctor of Divinity or showed the
slightest desire to be made equal to his colleagues in this
respect. Unlike the rest of his Wittenberg associates, he
had not been an ecclesiastic previous to leaving Catholicism,
nor would he ever consent to undertake the task of preacher
in the Lutheran Church, or to receive Lutheran Orders,
though for some years he, on Sundays, was wont to expound
in Latin the Gospels to the students; these homilies
resulted in his Postils. When Luther at last, in 1520,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
persuaded him to marry the daughter of the Burgomaster
of Wittenberg, he thereby succeeded in chaining to the
scene of his own labours this valuable and industrious little
man with all his vast treasures of learning. At the end of
the year Melanchthon, under the pseudonym of Didymus
Faventinus, composed his first defence of Luther, in which
he, the Humanist, entirely vindicated against Aristotle and
the Universities his attacks upon the rights of natural
reason.<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a></p>

<p>As early as December 14, 1518, Luther, under the charm
of his friend’s talents, had spoken of him in a letter to Johann
Reuchlin as a “wonderful man in whom almost everything
is supernatural.”<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a> On September 17, 1523, he said to his
friend Theobald Billicanus of Nördlingen: “I value Philip
as I do myself, not to speak of the fact that he shames, nay,
excels me by his learning and the integrity of his life (‘<i>eruditione
et integritate vitae</i>’).”<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> Five years later Luther penned
the following testimony in his favour in the Preface at the
commencement of Melanchthon’s Exposition of the Epistle
to the Colossians (1528-29): “He proceeds [in his writings]
quietly and politely, digs and plants, sows and waters,
according to the gifts which God has given him in rich
measure”; he himself, on the other hand, was “very
stormy and pugnacious” in his works, but he was “the
rough hewer, who has to cut out the track and prepare the
way.”<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a> In the Preface to the edition of his own Latin
works in 1545 he praises Melanchthon’s “<i>Loci</i>” and
classes them amongst the “methodic books” of which
every theologian and bishop would do well to make use;
“how much the Lord has effected by means of this instrument
which He has sent me, not merely in worldly learning
but also in theology, is demonstrated by his works.”<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a></p>

<p>The extravagant praise accorded by Luther to his fellow-worker
was returned by the other in equal measure. When
deprived of Luther’s company during the latter’s involuntary
stay at the Wartburg, he wrote as follows to a friend:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
“The torch of Israel was lighted by him, and should it be
extinguished what hope would remain to us?... Ah,
could I but purchase by my death the life of him who is at
this time the most divine being upon earth!”<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a> A little later
he says in the same style: “Our Elias has left us; we wait
and hope in him. My longing for him torments me daily.”<a name="FNanchor_1062_1062" id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a>
Luther was not unwilling to figure as Elias and wrote to his
friend that he (Melanchthon) excelled him in the Evangel,
and should he himself perish, would succeed him as an
Eliseus with twice the spirit of Elias.</p>

<p>We cannot explain these strange mutual encomiums
merely by the love of exaggeration usual with the Humanists.
Luther as a rule did not pander to the taste of the
Humanists, and as for Melanchthon, he really entertained
the utmost respect and devotion for the “venerable father”
and “most estimable doctor” until, at last, difference of
opinion and character brought about a certain unmistakable
coolness between the two men.</p>

<p>Melanchthon, albeit with great moderation and reserve,
never quitted the reformer’s standpoint as regards either
theory or practice. Many Catholic contemporaries were
even of opinion that he did more harm to the Church by his
prudence and apparent moderation than Luther by all his
storming. His soft-spoken manner and advocacy of peace
did not, however, hinder him from voicing with the utmost
bitterness his hatred of everything Catholic, and his white-hot
prejudice in favour of the innovations. He wrote, for
instance, at the end of 1525 in an official memorandum
(“<i>de iure reformandi</i>”) intended for the evangelical Princes
and Estates that, even should “war and scandal” ensue,
still they must not desist from the introduction and maintenance
of the new religious system, for our cause “touches
the honour of Christ,” and the doctrine of Justification by
Faith alone in particular, so he says, “will not suffer the
contrary.” Why heed the complaints of the Catholics and
the Empire? Christ witnessed “the destruction of the
Kingdom of the Jews” and yet proceeded with His work.
According to this memorandum there was no need of waiting
for the Pope’s permission to “reform” things; the
people are everywhere “bound to accept the doctrine [of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Luther]” while evangelical Princes and authorities are “not
bound to obey the edicts [of the Empire]; hence, in fairness,
they cannot be scolded as schismatics.”<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a> For such a ruthless
invitation to overturn the old-established order Melanchthon
sought to reassure himself and others by alleging the
“horrible abuses” of Popery which it had become necessary
to remove; the war was to be only against superstition and
idolatry, the tyranny of the ecclesiastical system challenging
resistance.<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a></p>

<p>Then and ever afterwards the Pope appeared to him in
the light of Antichrist, with whom no reconciliation was
possible unless indeed he yielded to Luther.</p>

<p>In the same year in which he wrote the above his correspondence
begins to betray the anxiety and apprehension
which afterwards never ceased to torture him, due partly
to what he witnessed of the results of the innovations,
partly to his own natural timidity. The Peasant War of
1525 plunged him into dismay. There he saw to what
lengths the abuse of evangelical freedom could lead, once
the passions of the people were let loose. At the express
wish of the Elector Ludwig of the Palatinate he wrote in
vigorous and implacable language a refutation of the
Peasant Articles; the pen of the scholar was, however,
powerless to stay the movement which was carrying away
the people.</p>

<p>A work of much greater importance fell to him when he was
invited to take part in the Visitation of the churches in the
Saxon Electorate, then in a state of utter chaos; it was
then that he wrote, in 1527, the Visitation-booklet for the
use of the ecclesiastical inspectors.</p>

<p>In the directions he therein gave for the examination of
pastors and preachers he modified to such an extent the
asperities of the Lutheran principles that he was accused of
reacting in the direction of Catholicism, particularly by the
stress he laid on the motive of fear of God’s punishments,
on greater earnestness in penance and on the keeping of
the “law.” Luther’s preaching of the glad Evangel had
dazzled people and made them forgetful of the “law” and
Commandments. According to Melanchthon this was in
great part the fault of the Lutheran preachers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“In their addresses to the people,” he complains in 1526,
“they barely mention the fear of God. Yet this, and not faith
alone, is what they ought to teach.... On the other hand, they
are all the more zealous in belabouring the Pope.” Besides this
they are given to fighting with each other in the pulpit; the
authorities ought to see that only the “more reasonable are
allowed to preach and that the others hold their tongues, according
to Paul’s injunction.”<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> “They blame our opponents,” he
writes of these same preachers in 1528, “for merely serving their
bellies by their preaching, but they themselves appear only to
work for their own glory, so greatly do they allow themselves to
be carried away by anger.”<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a></p>

<p>“The depravity of the country population” he declares in a
letter of the same year to be intolerable; it must necessarily
call down the heavy hand of God’s chastisement. “The deepest
hatred of the Gospel” was, however, to be found “in those who
play the part of our patrons and protectors.” Here he is referring
to certain powerful ones; he also laments “the great
indifference of the Court.” All this shows the end to be approaching:
“Believe me, the Day of Judgment is not far distant.”
“When I contemplate the conditions of our age, I am troubled
beyond belief.”<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a></p>

<p>Regarding his recommendation of penance and confession
during the Visitations, a conversation which he relates to
Camerarius as having taken place at the table of a highly placed
patron of the innovations, is very characteristic. A distinguished
guest having complained of this recommendation, the patron
chimed in with the remark, that the people must “hold tight to
the freedom they had secured, otherwise they would again be
reduced to servitude by the theologians”; the latter were
little by little re-introducing the old traditions. Thus you see,
Melanchthon adds, “how, not only our enemies, but even those
who are supposed to be favourably bent, judge of us.”<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> Yet
Melanchthon had merely required a general sort of confession as
a voluntary preparation for Holy Communion.</p>

<p>Melanchthon was also openly in favour of the penalty of
excommunication; in order to keep a watch on the preachers he
introduced the system of Superintendents.</p>

<p>In the matter of marriage contracts his experience led him to
the following conclusion: “It is clearly expedient that the
marriage bond should be tightened rather than loosened”; in
this the older Church had been in the right. “You know,” he
writes, “what blame (‘<i>quantum sceleris</i>’) our party has incurred
by its wrong treatment of marriage matters. All the preachers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
everywhere ought to exert themselves to put an end to these
scandals. But many do nothing but publicly calumniate the
monks and the authorities in their discourses.” And yet in the
same letter he sanctions the re-marriage of a party divorced for
some unknown reason, a sanction he had hitherto been unwilling
to grant for fear of the example being followed by others; he
only stipulates that his sanction is not to be announced publicly;
the sermons must, on the contrary, censure the license which is
becoming the fashion.<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Any open and vigorous opposition to Luther’s views, so
detrimental to the inviolability of the marriage tie, was not
in accordance with Melanchthon’s nature. He, like Luther,
condemned the religious vows on the strange ground that
those who took them were desirous of gaining merit in the
sight of God. Hence he too came to invite nuns to marry.<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a>
And yet, at the same time, he, like Luther, again declared
virginity to be a “higher gift,” one which even ranked
above marriage (“<i>virginitas donum est praestantius coniugio</i>”).<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a></p>

<p>He was gradually drawn more and more into questions
concerning the public position of the Lutherans and had to
undertake various journeys on this account, because Luther,
being under the Ban, was unable to leave the Electorate,
and because his violent temper did not suit him for delicate
negotiations. Melanchthon erred rather on the side of
timidity.</p>

<p>When, in 1528, in consequence of the Pack business,
there seemed a danger of war breaking out on account of
religion, he became the prey of great anxiety. He feared
for the good name and for the evangelical cause should
bloody dissensions arise in the Empire through the fault
of the Princes who favoured Luther. On May 18 he wrote
to the Elector Johann on no account to commence war on
behalf of the Evangel, especially as the Emperor had made
proposals of peace. “I must take into consideration, for
instance, what a disgrace it would be to the Holy Gospel
were your Electoral Highness to commence war without
first having tried every means for securing peace.”<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
can be no doubt that the terrible experience of the Peasant
War made him cautious, but we must not forget, that such
considerations did not hinder him from declaring frequently
later, particularly previous to the Schmalkalden War, that
armed resistance was allowable, nay, called for, nor even
from going so far as to address the people in language every
whit as warlike as that of Luther.<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> In the case of the
hubbub arising out of the famous forged documents connected
with the name of Pack, Luther, however, seemed to
him to be going much too far. “Duke George could prove
with a clear conscience that it was a question of a mere
forgery and of a barefaced deception,”<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> got up to the detriment
of the Catholic party. On Luther’s persisting in his
affirmation that a league existed for the destruction of the
Evangelicals, and that the “enemies of the Evangel”
really cherished “this evil intention and will,”<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> Duke
George did, as a matter of fact, take him severely to task
in a work to which Luther at once replied in another teeming
with unseemly abuse.<a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a></p>

<p>Melanchthon, like the rest of Luther’s friends who shared
his opinion, saw their hopes of peace destroyed. They read
with lively disapproval Luther’s charges against the Duke,
who was described as a thief, as one “eaten up by Moabitish
pride and arrogance,” who played the fool in thus raging
against Christ; as one possessed of the devil, who in spite
of all his denials meditated the worst against the Lutherans,
who allowed himself to be served in his Chancery by a gang
of donkeys and who, like all his friends, was devil-ridden.
Concerning the impression created, Melanchthon wrote to
Myconius that Luther had indeed tried to exercise greater
restraint than usual, but that “he ought to have defended
himself more becomingly. All of us who have read his
pages stand aghast; unfortunately such writings are
popular, they pass from hand to hand and are studied,
being much thought of by fools (‘<i>praedicantur a stultis</i>’).”<a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>It was only with difficulty that he and his Wittenberg
friends dissuaded Luther from again rushing into
the fray.</p>

<p>In 1529 Melanchthon, at Luther’s desire, accompanied
the Elector of Saxony to the Diet of Spires. The protest
there made by the Lutheran Princes and Estates again
caused him great concern as he foresaw the unhappy
consequences to Germany of the rupture it betokened, and
the danger in which it involved the Protestant cause. The
interference of the Zwinglians in German affairs also filled
him with apprehension, for of their doctrines, so far as they
were opposed to those of Wittenberg, he cherished a deep
dislike imbibed from Luther. The political alliance which,
at Spires, the Landgrave of Hesse sought to promote between
the two parties, appeared to him highly dangerous from the
religious point of view. He now regretted that he had
formerly allowed himself to be more favourably disposed
to Zwinglianism by the Landgrave. In his letters he was
quite open in the expression of his annoyance at the results
of the Diet of Spires, though he himself had there done his
best to increase the falling away from Catholicism, and, with
words of peace on his lips, to render the estrangement
irremediable. In his first allusion to the now famous protest
he speaks of it as a “horrid thing.”<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> His misgivings increased
after his return home, and he looked forward to the
future with anxiety. He was pressing in his monitions
against any alliance with the Zwinglians. On May 17, 1529,
he wrote to Hieronymus Baumgärtner, a member of the
Nuremberg Council: “Some of us do not scorn an alliance
with the [Zwinglian] Strasburgers, but do you do your
utmost to prevent so shameful a thing.”<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a> “The pains of
hell have encompassed me,” so he describes to a friend his
anxieties. We have delayed too long, “I would rather die
than see ours defiled by an alliance with the Zwinglians.”<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a>
“I know that the Zwinglian doctrine of the Sacrament of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
the Body and Blood of Christ is untrue and not to be
answered for before God.”<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a></p>

<p>After he had assisted Luther in the religious discussion
held at Marburg between him and Zwingli in the autumn of
1529, and had witnessed the fruitless termination of the
conference, he again voiced his intense grief at the discord
rampant among the innovators, and the hopelessness of
any effort to reunite Christians. “I am quite unable to
mitigate the pains I suffer on account of the position of
ecclesiastical affairs,” so he complains to Camerarius. “Not
a day passes that I do not long for death. But enough of
this, for I do not dare to describe in this letter the actual
state of things.”<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a></p>

<p>Luther was much less down-hearted at that time, having
just succeeded in overcoming a persistent attack of anxiety
and remorse of conscience. His character, so vastly different
from that of his friend, now, after the victory he had won
over his “temptations,” was more than ever inclined to
violence and defiance. Luther, such at least is his own
account, refused to entertain any fear concerning the success
of his cause, which was God’s, in spite of the storm threatening
at Augsburg.</p>

<h4><i>Melanchthon at the Diet of Augsburg, 1530.</i></h4>

<p>At Augsburg the most difficult task imaginable was
assigned to Melanchthon, as the principal theological
representative of Lutheranism. His attitude at the Diet
was far from frank and logical.</p>

<p>He made his own position quite puzzling by his vain
endeavour to unite things incapable of being united, and to
win, by actual or apparent concessions, temporary toleration
for the new religious party within the Christian Church
to which the Empire belonged. Owing to his lack of theological
perspicuity he does not appear to have seen as clearly
as Luther how hopeless was the rupture between old and
new. He still had hopes that the Catholics would gradually
come over to the Wittenberg standpoint when once an
agreement had been reached regarding certain outward and
subordinate matters, as he thought them. “Real unification,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>”
as Johannes Janssen says very truly, “was altogether
out of the question.” For the point at issue in this tremendous
ecclesiastical contest was not this or that religious
dogma, this or that addition or alteration in Church discipline;
it was not even a question merely of episcopal
jurisdiction and the sense in which this was understood and
allowed by Protestant theologians; what was fundamentally
at stake was no less than the acceptance or rejection of the
doctrine of the infallibility of the Church, and the recognition
or non-recognition of the Church as a Divine and
human institution of grace, resting upon the perpetual
sacrifice and priesthood. The Protestants rejected the
dogma of the infallibility of the Church and set up for themselves
a novel ecclesiastical system, they also rejected the
perpetual sacrifice in that they denied the doctrine of the
perpetual priesthood.... Hence the attempts at reconciliation
made at Augsburg, as indeed all later attempts,
were bound to come to nothing.<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a></p>

<p>In the “Confession of Augsburg,” where the author shows
himself a past-master in the art of presentation, Melanchthon
presents the Lutheran doctrine under the form most
acceptable to the opposite party, calculated, too, to prove
its connection with the teaching of the Roman Church as
vouched for by the Fathers. He passes over in silence
certain capital elements of Lutheran dogma, for instance,
man’s unfreedom in the performance of moral acts pleasing
to God, likewise predestination to hell,<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> and even the
rejection on principle of the Papal Primacy, the denial of
Indulgences and of Purgatory. A Catholic stamp was impressed
on the doctrine of the Eucharist so as to impart to
it the semblance of the doctrine of Transubstantiation;
even in the doctrine of justification, any clear distinction
between the new teaching of the justifying power of faith
alone and the Catholic doctrine of faith working by love
(“<i>fides formata charitate</i>”) is wanting. Where, in the
second part, he deals with certain traditions and abuses
which he holds to have been the real cause of the schism,
he persists in minimising the hindrances to mutual agreement,
or at least to toleration of the new religious party.
According to this statement, all that Protestants actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
demanded was permission to receive communion under both
kinds, the marriage of priests, the abolition of private
masses, obligatory confession, fasts, religious vows, etc.
The bishops, who were also secular princes, were to retain
their jurisdiction as is expressely stated at the end, though
they were to see that the true Gospel was preached in their
dioceses, and not to interfere with the removal of abuses.<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a></p>

<p>In the specious and seductive explanation of the “Confession,”
errors which had never been advocated by the
Church were refuted, while propositions were propounded
at great length which had never been questioned by her, in
both cases the aim being to win over the reader to the
author’s side and to divert his attention from the actual
subject of the controversy.</p>

<p>Luther, to whom the work was submitted when almost
complete, allowed it to pass practically without amendment.
He saw in it Melanchthon’s “soft-spoken manner,” but
nevertheless gave it his assent.<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a></p>

<p>He was quite willing to leave the matter in the hands of
such trusty and willing friends as Melanchthon and his
theological assistants at Augsburg, and to rely on the
prudence and strength of the Princes and Estates of the new
profession there assembled. Secure in the “Gospel-proviso”
the Coburg hermit was confident of not being a loser even in
the event of the negotiations not issuing favourably. Christ
was not to be deposed from His throne; to “Belial” He
at least could not succumb.<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a></p>

<p>The “Confession of Augsburg” was not at all intended
in the first instance as a symbolic book, but rather as a
deed presented to the Empire on the part of the protesting
Princes and Estates to demonstrate their innocence and
vindicate their right to claim toleration. During the years
that followed it was likewise regarded as a mere Profession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
on the part of the Princes, i.e. as a theological declaration
standing on the same level as the Schmalkalden agreement,
and forming the bond of the protesting Princes in the
presence of the Empire; each one was still free to amplify,
explain, or modify the faith within his own territories.
Finally, however, after the religious settlement at Augsburg
in 1555, Melanchthon’s work began to be regarded as a
binding creed, and this character was to all practical purposes
stamped on it by the “Concord” in 1580.<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a></p>

<p>On August 3, 1530, a “Confutation of the Confession of
Augsburg,” composed by Catholic theologians, was read
before the Estates at the Diet of Augsburg. The Emperor
called upon the Protestants to return to the Church,
threatening, in case of refusal, that he, as the “Guardian
and Protector” of Christendom, would institute proceedings.
Yet in spite of this he preferred to follow a milder
course of action and to seek a settlement by means of lengthy
“transactions.”</p>

<p>The “Reply” to the Confession (later known as “<i>Confutatio
Confessionis Augustanæ</i>”), which was the result
of the deliberations of a Catholic commission, set forth
excellent grounds for rejecting the errors contained in
Melanchthon’s work, and also threw a clear light on his
reservations and intentional ambiguities.<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> Melanchthon’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
answer was embodied in his “<i>Apologia Confessionis
Augustanæ</i>,” which well displays its author’s ability and
also his slipperiness, and later took its place, side by side
with the Confession, as the second official exposition of
Lutheranism. It energetically vindicates Luther’s distinctive
doctrines, and above all declares, again quite
falsely, that the doctrine of justificatory faith was the old,
traditional Catholic doctrine. Nor does it refrain from
strong and insulting language, particularly in the official
German version. The opposite party it describes as shameless
liars, rascals, blasphemers, hypocrites, rude asses,
hopeless, senseless sophists, traitors, etc.<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> This, together
with the “<i>Confessio Augustana</i>,” was formally subscribed
at the Schmalkalden meeting in 1537 by all the theologians
present at the instance of the Evangelical Estates. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
it came to rank with the Confession of the Princes and, like
the former, was incorporated later, in both the Latin and
the oldest German version, in the symbolic books.<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a></p>

<p>Melanchthon, in the “<i>Apologia</i>,” re-stated anew the
charges already raised in the “<i>Confessio</i>” against Catholic
dogma, nor did the proofs and assurances to the contrary
of the authors of the “<i>Confutatio</i>” deter him from again
foisting on the Catholic Church doctrines she had never
taught. Thus he speaks of her as teaching, that the forgiveness
of sins could be merited simply by man’s own
works (without the grace and the merits of Christ); he also
will have it that the effect of grace had formerly been
altogether lost sight of until it was at last brought again to
light&mdash;though as a matter of fact “it had been taught
throughout the whole world.”<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a></p>

<p>We must come back in detail to the allegations made in
the Confession, and more particularly in the Apology,
that Augustine was in favour of the Lutheran doctrine of
Justification; this is all the more necessary since the
Reformers, at the outset, were fond of claiming the authority
of Augustine on their behalf. At the same time the admissions
contained in Melanchthon’s letters will show us more
clearly the morality of his behaviour in a matter of such
capital importance.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">At the time when the Confession was printed it had already
long been clear to him that the principal exponent of the doctrine
of grace in the ancient Church, viz. St. Augustine, was against
the Protestant conception of justification.</p>

<p>On this subject he expressed himself openly at the end of May,
1531, in a confidential letter to Brenz. Here he speaks of the
doctrine of Augustine as “a fancy from which we must turn
aside our mind (‘<i>animus revocandus ab Augustini imaginatione</i>’)”;
his ideas disagreed with St. Paul’s doctrine; whoever
followed Augustine must teach like him, “that we are
regarded as just by God, through fulfilling the commandments
under the action of the Holy Ghost, and not through faith alone.”<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a></p>

<p>In spite of this, Melanchthon, in the “<i>Confessio Augustana</i>,”
had the courage to appeal publicly to Augustine as the most
prominent and clearest witness to the Lutheran view of faith
and justification, and this he did almost at the very time when
penning the above letter, viz. in April or May, 1531, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
first draft of the “<i>Confessio</i>” was sent to the press.<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> According
to the authentic version, Melanchthon’s words were: “That,
concerning the doctrine of faith, no new interpretation had been
introduced, could be proved from Augustine, who treats diligently
of this matter and teaches that we obtain grace and are justified
before God by faith in Christ and not by works, as his whole
book ‘<i>De Spiritu et littera</i>’ proves.”<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a></p>

<p>The writer of these words felt it necessary to explain to Brenz
why he had ventured to claim this Father as being in “entire
agreement.” He had done so because this was “the general
opinion concerning him (‘<i>propter publicam de eo persuasionem</i>’),<a name="FNanchor_1096_1096" id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a>
though, as a matter of fact, he did not sufficiently expound the
justificatory potency of faith.” The “general opinion” was,
however, merely a groundless view invented by Luther and his
theologians and accepted by a certain number of those who
blindly followed him. In the Apology of the Confession, he
continues, “I expounded more fully the doctrine [of faith
alone], but was not able to speak there as I do now to you,
although, on the whole, I say the same thing; it was not to be
thought of on account of the calumnies of our opponents.” Thus
in the Apology also, even when it was a question of the cardinal
point of the new teaching, Melanchthon was of set purpose
having recourse to dissimulation. If he had only to fear the
calumnies of opponents, surely his best plan would have been
to silence them by telling them in all frankness what the Lutheran
position really was; otherwise he had no right to stigmatise
their attack on weak points of Luther’s doctrine as mere calumnies.
Yet, even in the “<i>Apologia</i>,” he appeals repeatedly
to Augustine in order to shelter the main Lutheran contentions
concerning faith, grace, and good works under the ægis of
his name.<a name="FNanchor_1097_1097" id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Melanchthon’s endeavour to secure for Protestantism a
place within the older Church and to check the threatened
repressive measures, led him to write letters to the Bishop
of Augsburg, to Campeggio, the Papal Legate, and to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
secretary, in which he declares stoutly, that the restoration
of ecclesiastical harmony simply depended on two points,
viz. the sanction of communion under both kinds and the
marriage of the clergy, as though forsooth the two sides
agreed in belief and as though his whole party acknowledged
the Pope and the Roman Church.</p>

<p>In the letter to Cardinal Campeggio he even assures him:
“We reverence the authority of the Pope of Rome and the
whole hierarchy, and only beg he may not cast us off....
For no other reason are we hated as we are in Germany
than because we defend and uphold the dogmas of the
Roman Church with so much persistence. And this loyalty
to Christ and to the Roman Church we shall preserve to our
last breath, even should the Church refuse to receive us
back into favour.” The words “Roman Church” were not
here taken in the ordinary sense, however much the connection
might seem to warrant this; Melanchthon really
means his pet phantom of the ancient Roman Church,
though he saw fit to speak of fidelity to this phantom in
the very words in which people were wont to protest their
fidelity to the existing Roman Church. He further asked
of the Cardinal toleration for the Protestant peculiarities,
on the ground that they were “insignificant matters which
might be allowed or passed over in silence”; at any rate
“some pretext might easily be found for tolerating them,
at least until a Council should be summoned.”<a name="FNanchor_1098_1098" id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a></p>

<p>Campeggio and his advisers refused to be led astray by
such assurances.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some representatives of the Curia,
theologians or dignitaries of the German Church, allowed
themselves to be cajoled by Melanchthon’s promises to the
extent of entering into negotiations with him in the hope of
bringing him back to the Church.<a name="FNanchor_1099_1099" id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a> Such was, for instance,
in 1537, the position of Cardinal Sadolet.</p>

<p>To Sadolet, Johann Fabri sent the following warning:
“Only the man who is clever enough to cure an incurable
malady, will succeed in leading Philip&mdash;a real Vertumnus
and Proteus&mdash;back to the right path.”<a name="FNanchor_1100_1100" id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>Melanchthon was nevertheless pleased to be able to
announce that Cardinal Campeggio had stated he could
grant a dispensation for Communion under both kinds and
priestly marriage.<a name="FNanchor_1101_1101" id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a></p>

<p>With this Luther was not much impressed: “I reply,”
he wrote to his friends in the words of Amsdorf, “that I
s&mdash;&mdash; on the dispensation of the Legate and his master;
<i>we</i> can find dispensations enough.”<a name="FNanchor_1102_1102" id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a> His own contention
always was and remained the following: “As I have always
declared, I am ready to concede everything, but they must
let us have the Evangel.”<a name="FNanchor_1103_1103" id="FNanchor_1103_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a> To Spalatin, he says later:
“Are we to crave of Legate and Pope what they may be
willing to grant us? Do, I beg you, speak to them in the
fashion of Amsdorf.”<a name="FNanchor_1104_1104" id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a></p>

<p>On the abyss which really separated the followers of the
new faith from the Church, Luther’s coarse and violent
writing, “Vermanũg an die Geistlichen zu Augsburg,”
throws a lurid light. Luther also frequently wrote to cheer
Melanchthon and to remind him of the firmness which was
needed.</p>

<p>Melanchthon was a prey to unspeakable inward terrors,
and had admitted to Luther that he was “worn out with
wretched cares.”<a name="FNanchor_1105_1105" id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> Luther felt called upon to encourage him
by instancing his own case. He was even more subject to
such fits of anxiety than Melanchthon, but, however weak
inwardly, he never winced before outward troubles or ever
manifested his friend’s timidity. Melanchthon ought to
display the same strength in public dealings as he did in his
inward trials.<a name="FNanchor_1106_1106" id="FNanchor_1106_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>The Landgrave Philip, a zealous supporter of Luther and
Zwingli, was not a little incensed at Melanchthon’s attempts
at conciliation, the more so as the latter persisted in
refusing to have anything to do with Zwinglianism. In one
of his dispatches to his emissaries at Augsburg, Philip says:
“For mercy’s sake stop the little game of Philip, that shy
and worldly-wise reasoner&mdash;to call him nothing else.”<a name="FNanchor_1107_1107" id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> The
Nuremberg delegates also remonstrated with him. Baumgärtner
of Nuremberg, who was present at the Diet of
Augsburg, relates that Philip flew into a temper over the
negotiations and startled everybody by his cursing and
swearing; he was determined to have the whole say himself
and would not listen to the Hessian envoys and those
of the cities. He “did nothing” but run about and indulge
in unchristian manœuvres; he put forward “unchristian
proposals” which it was “quite impossible” to accept;
“then he would say, ‘Oh, would that we were away!’”
The result would be, that, owing to this duplicity, the
“tyrants would only be all the more severe”; “no one
at the Reichstag had hitherto done the cause of the Evangel
so much harm as Philip”; it was high time for Luther “to
interfere with Philip and warn pious Princes against him.”<a name="FNanchor_1108_1108" id="FNanchor_1108_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the Protestant so-called “Concessions” which
came under discussion in connection with the “<i>Confutatio</i>”
was that of episcopal jurisdiction, a point on which Melanchthon
and Brenz laid great stress. It was, however, of such a
nature as not to offend in the least the protesting Princes
and towns. In the event of their sanctioning the innovations,
the bishops were simply “to retain their secular
authority”: Melanchthon and Brenz, here again, wished
to maintain the semblance of continuity with the older
Church, and, by means of the episcopate, hoped to strengthen
their own position. Such temporising, and the delay it
involved, at least served the purpose of gaining time, a
matter of the utmost importance to the Protestant representatives.<a name="FNanchor_1109_1109" id="FNanchor_1109_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a></p>

<p>Another point allowed by Melanchthon, viz. the omission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
of the word “alone” in the statement “man is justified by
faith,” was also of slight importance, for all depended on
the sense attached to it, and the party certainly continued
to exclude works and charity. Melanchthon, however, also
agreed that it should be taught that penance has three
essential elements, viz. contrition, confession of sin and
satisfaction, i.e. active works of penance, “a concession,”
Döllinger says, “which, if meant seriously, would have
thrown the whole new doctrine of justification into confusion.”<a name="FNanchor_1110_1110" id="FNanchor_1110_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a>
It may be that Melanchthon, amidst his manifold
worries, failed to perceive this.</p>

<p>At any rate, all his efforts after a settlement were ruled
by the “Proviso of the Gospel”<a name="FNanchor_1111_1111" id="FNanchor_1111_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a> as propounded by Luther
to his friends in his letters from the Coburg. According to
this tacit reservation no concession which in any way
militated against the truth or the interests of the Evangel
could be regarded as valid. “Once we have evaded coercion
and obtained peace,” so runs Luther’s famous admonition
to Melanchthon, “then it will be an easy matter to amend
our wiles and slips because God’s mercy watches over us.”<a name="FNanchor_1112_1112" id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a>
“All our concessions,” Melanchthon wrote, “are so much
hampered with exceptions that I apprehend the bishops will
suspect we are offering them chaff instead of grain.”<a name="FNanchor_1113_1113" id="FNanchor_1113_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">A letter, intended to be reassuring, written from Augsburg on
September 11 by Brenz, who was somewhat more communicative
than Melanchthon, and addressed to his friend Isenmann, who
was anxious concerning the concessions being offered, may serve
further to elucidate the policy of Melanchthon and Brenz. Brenz
writes: “If you consider the matter carefully you will see that
our proposals are such as to make us appear to have yielded to a
certain extent; whereas, in substance, we have made no concessions
whatsoever. This they plainly understand. What, may
I ask, are the Popish fasts so long as we hold the doctrine
of freedom?” The real object of the last concession, he had
already pointed out, was to avoid giving the Emperor and his
Court the impression that they were “preachers of sensuality.”
The jurisdiction conceded to the bishops will not harm us so long
as they “agree to our <i>Via media</i> and conditions”; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
themselves will then become new men, thanks to the Evangel;
“for always and everywhere we insist upon the proviso of
freedom and purity of doctrine. Having this, what reason would
you have to grumble at the jurisdiction of the bishops?”<a name="FNanchor_1114_1114" id="FNanchor_1114_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a> It
will, on the contrary, be of use to us, and will serve as a buffer
against the wilfulness of secular dignitaries, who oppress our
churches with heavy burdens. “Besides, it is not to be
feared that our opponents will agree to the terms.” The main
point is, so Melanchthon’s confidential fellow-labourer concludes,
that only thus can we hope to secure “toleration for our doctrine.”<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">When Melanchthon penned this confession only a few
days had elapsed since Luther, in response to anxious letters
received from Augsburg, had intervened with a firm hand
and spoken out plainly against the concessions, and any
further attempts at a diplomatic settlement.<a name="FNanchor_1116_1116" id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a></p>

<p>In obedience to these directions Melanchthon began to
withdraw more and more from the position he had taken up.</p>

<p>The most favourable proposals of his opponents were no
longer entertained by him, and he even refused to fall in
with the Emperor’s suggestion that Catholics living in
Protestant territories should be left free to practise their
religion. The Elector of Saxony’s divines, together with
Melanchthon, in a memorandum to their sovereign, declared,
on this occasion, that it was not sufficient for
preachers to preach against the Mass, but that the Princes
also must refuse to sanction it, and must forbid it. “Were
we to say that Princes might abstain from forbidding it,
and that preachers only were to declaim against it, one
could well foresee what [small] effect the doctrine and
denunciations of the preachers would have.”<a name="FNanchor_1117_1117" id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a> “The
theologians,” remarks Janssen, “thus gave it distinctly to
be understood that the new doctrine could not endure without
the aid of the secular authority.”<a name="FNanchor_1118_1118" id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> Hence, at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
decisive moment, the Protestant Princes proclaimed intolerance
of Catholics as much a matter of conscience as
the confiscation of Church property. To the demand of the
Emperor for restitution of the temporalities, the Princes,
supported by the theologians, answered, that “they did
not consider themselves bound to obey, since this matter
concerned their conscience, against which there ran no
prescription” (on the part of those who had been despoiled).<a name="FNanchor_1119_1119" id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a></p>

<p>Thus, with Melanchthon’s knowledge and approval, the
two principal factors in the whole Reformation, viz. intolerance
and robbery of Church property, played their
part even here at the turning-point of German history.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">On his return from the Coburg to Wittenberg, as already
described (p. 45 f.), Luther in his sermons showed how the
Evangel which he proclaimed had to be preached, even at the
expense of war and universal desolation: “The cry now is, that,
had the Evangel not been preached, things would never have
fallen out thus, but everything would have remained calm and
peaceful. No, my friend, but things will improve; Christ
speaks: ‘I have more things to say to you and to judge’; the
fact is you must leave this preaching undisturbed, else there
shall not remain to you one stick nor one stone upon another, and
you may say: ‘These words are not mine, but the words of the
Father.’” (cp. John viii. 26).<a name="FNanchor_1120_1120" id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a></p>

<p>Yet, at the time of the Diet of Augsburg, Luther, for all his
inexorable determination, was not unmindful of the temporal
assistance promised by the Princes. He hinted at this with
entire absence of reserve in a letter, not indeed to Melanchthon,
who was averse to war, but to Spalatin: “Whatever the issue
[of the Diet] may be, do not fear the victors and their craft.
Luther is still at large and so is the Macedonian” (i.e. Philip of
Hesse, whom Melanchthon had thus nicknamed after the warlike
Philip of Macedonia). The “Macedonian” seemed to Luther
a sort of “Ismael,” like unto Agar’s son, whom Holy Scripture
had described as a wild man, whose hand is raised against all
(Gen. xvi. 12). Luther was aware that Philip had quitted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
Diet in anger and was now nursing his fury, as it were, in the
desert. “He is at large,” he says in biblical language, “and
thence may arise prudence to meet cunning and Ismael to
oppose the enemy. Be strong and act like men. There was
nothing to fear if they fought with blunted weapons.”<a name="FNanchor_1121_1121" id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a> Philip’s
offer of a refuge in Hesse had helped to render Luther more
defiant.<a name="FNanchor_1122_1122" id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a></p>

<p>Exhortations such as these increased the unwillingness of his
friends at Augsburg to reach any settlement by way of real
concessions. All hopes of a peaceful outcome of the negotiations
were thus doomed.</p></div>

<p class="p1">The Reichstagsabschied which finally, on November 19,
1530, brought Parliament to an end, witnessed to the
hopelessness of any lasting peace; it required, however,
that the bishoprics, monasteries, and churches which had
been destroyed should be re-erected, and that the parishes
still faithful to Catholicism should enjoy immunity under
pain of the ban of the Empire.<a name="FNanchor_1123_1123" id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a></p>

<p>Looking back at Melanchthon’s attitude at the Diet, we
can understand the severe strictures of recent historians.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“We cannot get rid of the fact,” writes Georg Ellinger, Melanchthon’s
latest Protestant biographer, “that, on the whole, his
attitude at the Diet of Augsburg does not make a pleasing impression.”
“That the apprehension of seeing the realisation of
his principles frustrated led him to actions which can in no wise
be approved, may be freely admitted.” It is true that Ellinger
emphasises very strongly the “mitigating circumstances,” but he
also remarks: “He had no real comprehension of the importance
of the ecclesiastical forms involved [in his concessions], and
this same lack of penetration served him badly even later. The
method by which he attempted to put his plans into execution
displays nothing of greatness but rather that petty slyness which
seeks to overreach opponents by the use of ambiguous words....
He had recourse to this means in the hope of thus arriving more
easily at his goal.” His “little tricks,” he proceeds, “at least
delayed the business for a while,” to the manifest advantage of
the Protestant cause.<a name="FNanchor_1124_1124" id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a> He candidly admits that Melanchthon,
both before and after the Diet of Augsburg, owing to his weak and
not entirely upright character, was repeatedly caught “having
recourse to the subterfuges of a slyness not far removed from
dissimulation.”<a name="FNanchor_1125_1125" id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> In proof of this he instances the expedient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
invented by Melanchthon for the purpose of evading the conference
with Zwingli at Marburg which was so distasteful to him.
“The Elector was to behave as though Melanchthon had, in a
letter, requested permission to attend such a conference, and
had been refused it. Melanchthon would then allege this to the
Landgrave of Hesse [who was urging him to attend the conference]
‘in order that His Highness may be pacified by so
excellent an excuse.’”<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> Ellinger, most impartially, also adduces
other devices to which Melanchthon had recourse at a later
date.<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a></p>

<p>The conduct of the leader of the Protestant party at the Diet
of Augsburg, more particularly his concern in the document
addressed to the Legate Campeggio, is stigmatised as follows by
Karl Sell, the Protestant historian. “This tone, this sudden
reduction of the whole world-stirring struggle to a mere wrangle
about trifles, and this recognition, anything but religious, of the
Roman Church, comes perilously near conscious deception. Did
Melanchthon really believe it possible to outwit diplomats so
astute by such a blind? In my opinion it is unfair to reproach
him with treason or even servility; what he was guilty of was
merely duplicity.” Campeggio, Sell continues, of these and
similar advances made by the Protestant spokesmen, wrote:
“They answer as heretics are wont, viz. in cunning and ambiguous
words.”<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a></p>

<p>Even in the “Theologische Realenzyklopädie des Protestantismus”
a suppressed note of disapproval of Melanchthon’s
“mistakes and weaknesses” is sounded. His attitude at the
Diet, the authors of the article on Melanchthon say, “was not so
pleasing as his learned labours on the Augsburg Confession”;
“a clear insight into the actual differences” as well as a “dignified
and firm attitude” was lacking; “this applies particularly
to his letter to the Papal Legate.”<a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a></p>

<p>We can understand how Döllinger, in his work “Die Reformation,”
after referring to Melanchthon’s palpable self-contradictions,
speaks of his solemn appeal to the doctrine of St. Augustine
as an intentional and barefaced piece of deception, an untruth
“which he deemed himself allowed.” Döllinger, without mincing
matters, speaks of his “dishonesty,” and relentlessly brands his
misleading statements; they leave us to choose between two
alternatives, either he was endeavouring to deceive and trick the
Catholics, or he had surrendered the most important and distinctive
Protestant doctrines, and was ready to lend a hand in
re-establishing the Catholic teaching.<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Luther, so far as we are aware, never blamed his friend,
either publicly or in his private letters, for his behaviour
during this crisis, nor did he ever accuse him of “treason
to the Evangelical cause.”<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> He only expresses now and
then his dissatisfaction at the useless protraction of the
proceedings and scolds him jokingly “for his fears, timidity,
cares and lamentations.”<a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> No real blame is contained in
the words he addressed to Melanchthon: “So long as the
Papacy subsists among us, our doctrine cannot subsist....
Thank God that you are having nothing from it.” “I
know that in treating of episcopal authority you have
always insisted on the Gospel proviso, but I fear that later
our opponents will say we were perfidious and fickle (‘<i>perfidos
et inconstantes</i>’) if we do not keep to what they want....
In short, all these transactions on doctrine displease
me, because nothing comes of them so long as the Pope does
not do away with his Papacy.”<a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> A fortnight later Luther
cordially blessed his friend, who was then overwhelmed
with trouble: “I pray you, my Philip, not to crucify yourself
in anxiety over the charges which are raised against
you, either verbally or in writing [by some of ours who
argue], that you are going too far.... They do not understand
what is meant by the episcopal authority which was
to be re-established, and do not rightly estimate the conditions
which we attach to it. Would that the bishops had
accepted it on these conditions! But they have too fine a
nose where their own interests are concerned and refuse to
walk into the trap.”<a name="FNanchor_1134_1134" id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a></p>

<h4><i>Melanchthon, the “Erasmian” Intermediary.</i></h4>

<p>A closer examination of the bent of Melanchthon’s mind
reveals a trait, common to many of Luther’s learned
followers at that time, which helps to explain his attitude
at Augsburg.</p>

<p>The real foundations of theology were never quite clear
to them because their education had been one-sidedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
Humanistic, and they had never studied theology proper.
They were fond of speaking and writing of the Church, of
Grace and Faith, but their ideas thereon were strangely
subjective, so much so that they did not even agree amongst
themselves. Hence, in their dealings with Catholic theologians
the latter often failed to understand them. The
fruitlessness of the conferences was frequently due solely
to this; though greatly prejudiced in Luther’s favour, they
still considered it possible for the chasm between the old
and the new to be bridged over, and longed earnestly for
such a consummation to be secured by some yielding on the
Catholic side; they were unwilling to break away from the
Church Universal, and, besides, they looked askance at the
moral consequences of the innovations and feared still
greater confusion and civil war.</p>

<p>That this was the spirit which animated Melanchthon is
evident from some of the facts already recorded.</p>

<p>He had nothing more at heart than to secure the atmosphere
essential for his studies and for the furtherance
of intellectual, particularly Humanistic, culture, and to
smooth the way for its general introduction into Germany.
His knowledge of theology had been acquired, as it were,
incidentally through his intercourse with Luther and his
study of Scripture; the latter, however, had been influenced
by his Humanism and, speaking generally, he contented
himself in selecting in the Bible certain general moral
truths which might serve as a rule of life. He indeed studied
the Fathers more diligently than Luther, the Greek Fathers
proving particularly attractive to him; it was, however,
chiefly a study of form, of culture, and of history, and as
regards theology little more than mere dilettantism. His
insight into the practical life of the Church left much to be
desired, otherwise the Anabaptist movement at Zwickau
would not have puzzled him as it did and left him in doubt
as to whether it came from God or the devil. His ignorance
of the gigantic intellectual labours of the Middle Ages in
the domain of theology made itself felt sensibly. He knew
even less of Scholasticism than did Luther, yet, after having
acquired a nodding acquaintance with it in its most debased
form, he, as a good pupil of Erasmus, proceeded to
condemn it root and branch. Every page of his writings
proves that his method of thought and expression, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
indecision, its groping, its dependence on echoes from the
classics, was far removed from the masterpieces of learning
and culture of the best days of the Middle Ages. Yet he
fancies himself entitled to censure Scholasticism and to
write in Luther’s style with a conceit only matched by his
ignorance: “You see what thick darkness envelops the
commentaries of the ancients and the whole doctrine of our
opponents, how utterly ignorant they are of what sin really
is, of the purpose of the law, of the blessings of the Gospel,
of prayer, and of man’s refuge when assailed by mental
terrors.”<a name="FNanchor_1135_1135" id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> The “mental terrors,” referred to here and
elsewhere, belonged to Luther’s world of thought. This
touch of mysticism, the only one to be found occasionally
in Melanchthon’s works, scarcely availed to render his
theology any the more profound.<a name="FNanchor_1136_1136" id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a></p>

<p>Hence, in fairness, his attempts at mediation when at
the Diet of Augsburg may be regarded as largely due to
ignorance and to his prejudice against Catholic theology.</p>

<p>We must, however, also take into consideration the
Humanist phantom of union and peace for the benefit of the
commonweal and particularly of scholarship; likewise his
frequently expressed aversion for public disorder, and his
fears of a decline of morals and of worse things to come.
Then only shall we be in a position to understand the
attitude of the man upon whose shoulders the burden of the
matter so largely rested. The trait chiefly to be held
accountable for his behaviour, viz. his peculiar, one-sided
Humanistic education, was well described by Luther later
on when Melanchthon was attacked by Cordatus and
Schenk for his tendency to water down dogma. Luther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
then spoke of the “Erasmian intermediaries” at whose
rough handling he was not in the least surprised.</p>

<h3>2. Disagreements and Accord between Luther and
Melanchthon</h3>

<p>Luther had good reason for valuing highly the theological
services which Melanchthon rendered him by placing his
ideas before the world in a form at once clearer and more
dignified. Points of theology and practice which he supplied
to his friend as raw material, Melanchthon returned duly
worked-up and polished. Luther’s views assumed practical
shape in passing through Melanchthon’s hands.<a name="FNanchor_1137_1137" id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a></p>

<p>At the outset the latter readily accepted all the doctrines
of his “<i>præceptor observandissimus</i>.” In the first edition of
the “<i>Loci</i>” (December, 1521) he made his own even
Luther’s harshest views, those, namely, concerning man’s
unfreedom and God’s being the author of evil.<a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> The faithful
picture of his doctrine which Luther there found so delighted
him, that he ventured to put the “<i>Loci</i>” on a level with the
canon of Holy Scripture (vol. ii., p. 239).</p>

<h4><i>Disagreements.</i></h4>

<p>As years passed by, Melanchthon allowed himself to
deviate more and more from Luther’s teaching. The latter’s
way of carrying every theological thesis to its furthest limit,
affrighted him. He yearned for greater freedom of action,
was desirous of granting a reasonable amount of room to
doubt, and was not averse to learning a thing or two even
from opponents. It was his Humanistic training which
taught him to put on the brake and even to introduce
several far-reaching amendments into Luther’s theories.
It was his Humanism which made him value the human
powers and the perfectibility of the soul, and thus to doubt
whether Luther was really in the right in his denial of freedom.
Such a doubt we find faintly expressed by him soon
after he had perused the “<i>Diatribe</i>” published by Erasmus
in 1524.<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> Luther’s reply (“<i>De servo arbitrio</i>”), to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
Melanchthon officially accorded his praise, failed to convince
him of man’s lack of freedom in the natural order. In
1526, in his lectures on Colossians (printed in 1528), he
openly rejected the view that God was the author of sin,
stood up for freedom in all matters of civil justice, and
declared that in such things it was quite possible to avoid
gross sin.<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a> In his new edition of the “<i>Loci</i>” in 1527 he
abandoned determinism and the denial of free-will, and
likewise the severer form of the doctrine of predestination,<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a>
such as he had still championed in the 1525 edition, but
which, he had now come to see, was at variance with the
proper estimate of man and human action.</p>

<p>Neither could Melanchthon ever bring himself to speak of
human reason, as compared to faith, in quite the same
language of disrespect as Luther.</p>

<p>That, on the occasion of the Visitation, he began to lay
stress on works as well as faith, has already been pointed
out.<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a> In this connection it is curious to note how, with his
usual caution and prudence where Luther and his more
ardent followers were concerned, he recommends that
works should be represented as praiseworthy only when
penance was being preached, but not, for instance, when
Justification was the subject, as, here, Lutherans, being
accustomed to hear so much of the “<i>sola fides</i>,” might well
take offence.<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a></p>

<p>In the matter of Justification, he, like Luther, made
everything to rest on that entirely outward covering
over of man by Christ’s merits received through faith, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
rather through confidence of salvation.<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> Indeed, Luther’s
greatest service, according to him, lay in his having made
this discovery. It was necessary, so he taught, that Christian
perfection should be made to consist solely in one’s
readiness, whenever oppressed by the sense of guilt, to find
consolation by wrapping oneself up in the righteousness of
Christ. Then the heart is “fearless, though our conscience
and the law continue to cry within us that we are unworthy.”
In other words, we must “take it as certain that
we have a God Who is gracious to us for Christ’s sake, be
our works what they may.”<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a></p>

<p>It was his advocacy of this doctrine, as the very foundation
of sanctification, which earned for him the striking
commendation we find in a letter written by Luther to
Jonas in 1529. Melanchthon had been of greater service to
the Church and the cause of holiness than “a thousand
fellows of the ilk of Jerome, Hilarion or Macarius, those
Saints of ceremonies and celibacy who were not worthy to
loose the laces of his boots nor&mdash;to boast a little&mdash;of yours
[Jonas’s], of Pomeranus [Bugenhagen], or even of mine.
For what have these self-constituted Saints and all the
wifeless bishops done which can compare with one year’s
work of Philip’s, or with his ‘<i>Loci</i>’?”<a name="FNanchor_1146_1146" id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a></p>

<p>Yet this very work was to bear additional testimony to
Melanchthon’s abandonment of several of Luther’s fundamental
doctrines.<a name="FNanchor_1147_1147" id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a></p>

<p>In 1530 and 1531 Melanchthon passed through a crisis,
and from that time forward a greater divergency in matters
of doctrine became apparent between the two friends. Even
in his work for the Diet in 1530 Melanchthon had assumed
a position of greater independence, and this grew more
marked when he began to plan a revised edition of his
“<i>Loci</i>.” He himself was later to acknowledge that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
views had undergone a change, though, in order to avoid
unpleasantness, he preferred to make out that the alteration
was less far-reaching than it really was. “You know,”
he wrote to an ardent admirer of Luther’s, “that I put
certain things concerning predestination, determination of
the will, necessity of obedience to the law, and grievous sin,
less harshly than does Luther. In all these things, as I
well know, Luther’s teaching is the same as mine, but there
are some unlearned persons, who, without at all understanding
them, pin their faith on certain rude expressions of
his.”<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a> But was Luther’s teaching really “the same”?
The truth is, that, on the points instanced, “Luther had
not only in earlier days taught a doctrine different from
that of Melanchthon, but continued to cherish the same to
the very end of his life.”<a name="FNanchor_1149_1149" id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> It fitted, however, the cowardly
character of Melanchthon to conceal as much as possible
these divergencies.</p>

<p>It is worth our while to examine a little more closely the
nature of the doctrinal differences between Luther and
Melanchthon, seeing that the latter&mdash;to quote the Protestant
theologian Gustav Krüger&mdash;was the real “creator of
evangelical theology” and the “founder of the evangelical
Church system.”<a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">As a matter of fact Melanchthon had already shaped out a
course of his own by the modifications which he had seen fit to
introduce in the original Confession of Augsburg.</p>

<p>Not only did he omit whatever displeased him in the new
doctrine, but he also formulated it in a way which manifestly
deviated from Luther’s own. Human co-operation, for instance,
plays a part much greater than with Luther. Unlike Luther,
he did not venture to assert plainly that the gift of faith was
the work of God independent of all human co-operation. Concerning
the “law,” too, he put forward a different opinion, which,
however, was not much better than Luther’s.<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a> In 1530, so says
Fr. Loofs, one of the most esteemed Protestant historians of
dogma, “he was no longer merely an interpreter of Luther’s
ideas.”<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a> “Yet he had not yet arrived at a finished theology of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
his own even in 1531, when he published the ‘<i>editio princeps</i>’ of
the ‘<i>Augustana</i>’ and the ‘<i>Apologia</i>.’”<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a> One of the first important
products of the change was the Commentary on Romans
which he published in 1532. Then, in 1535, appeared the revised
edition of the “<i>Loci</i>,” which, in its new shape, apart from mere
modifications of detail, was to serve as his measure for the last
twenty-five years of his life. “The ‘<i>Loci</i>’ of 1535 embody the
distinctive Melanchthonian theology.”<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a></p>

<p>“Thus, even before the death of Luther, and before altered
circumstances had restricted Melanchthon’s influence, the stamp
which the latter had impressed upon the principles of the Reformation
had already become the heritage of a large circle of evangelical
theologians.”<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a></p>

<p>Leaving aside the idea of an unconditional Divine predestination,
he spoke in both these works of the “<i>promissio universalis</i>”
of salvation. The Holy Ghost&mdash;such is his view on the question
of conversion&mdash;by means of the “Word” produces faith in those
who do not resist. The human will, which does not reject, but
accepts grace, forms, together with the “Word of God” and the
“Holy Ghost,” one of the three causes (“<i>tres causæ concurrentes</i>”)
of conversion. It is really to Luther’s deterministic
doctrine that the author of the “<i>Loci</i>” alludes in the 1535
edition: “The Stoics’ ravings about fate must find no place in
the Church.”<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a></p>

<p>Human co-operation in the work of salvation came to be
designated Synergism. The Protestant historian of dogma
mentioned above points out “that, by his adoption of Synergism,
Melanchthon forsook both the Lutheran tradition and his own
earlier standpoint.” The assumption of an unconditional Divine
predestination, such as we find it advocated by Luther, Zwingli,
Bucer, Calvin and others, was here “for the first time thrown
overboard by one of the Protestant leaders.”<a name="FNanchor_1157_1157" id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a> The same author,
after commenting on Melanchthon’s new exposition of justification
and the law in relation to the Gospel, declares that here, too,
Melanchthon had exploited “only a part of Luther’s thought and
had distorted some of the most precious truths we owe to the
Reformation.”<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a></p>

<p>This same charge we not seldom hear brought against Melanchthon
by up-to-date Protestant theologians. In the school of
Albert Ritschl it is, for instance, usual to say that he narrowed
the ideas of Luther, particularly in his conception of faith and of
the Church. The truth is that Melanchthon really did throw
overboard certain radical views which had been cherished by
Luther, particularly in his early days. The faith which is required
for salvation he comes more and more to take as faith in
all the articles of revelation, and not so much as a mere faith and
confidence in the forgiveness of sins and personal salvation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
“the first place is accorded no longer to trust but to doctrine,”<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a>
though, as will appear immediately, he did not feel quite sure of
his position. In his conception of the Church, too, he was more
disposed to see “an empirical reality and to insist on its doctrinal
side,”<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a> instead of looking on the Church, as Luther did, viz. as
the “invisible band of all who confess the Gospel.”<a name="FNanchor_1161_1161" id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> Johannes
Haussleiter, the Protestant editor of the Disputations held under
Melanchthon from 1546 onwards, thus feels justified in saying
that, “it was in Melanchthon’s school that the transition was
effected ... from a living confession born of faith and moulded
with the assistance of theology, to a firm, hard and rigid law of
doctrine.... This, from the point of view of history, spelt
retrogression.... If it was possible for such a thing to occur
at Wittenberg one generation after Luther’s ringing testimony in
favour of the freedom of a Christian Man, what might not be
feared for the future?”<a name="FNanchor_1162_1162" id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a></p>

<p>Carl Müller is also at pains to show that it was Melanchthon
who imbued the first generation of theologians&mdash;for whose
formation he, rather than Luther, was responsible&mdash;with the
idea of a Church which should be the guardian of that “pure
doctrine” to be enshrined in formularies of faith. According to
Müller it can never be sufficiently emphasised that the common
idea is all wrong, and that “to Luther himself the Church never
meant a congregation united by outward bonds or represented by
a hierarchy or any other legal constitution, rule or elaborate
creed, but nothing more than a union founded on the Gospel and
its confession”; Luther, according to him, remained “on the
whole” true to his ideal.<a name="FNanchor_1163_1163" id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a> How far the words “on the whole” are
correct, will be seen when we come to discuss Luther’s changes of
views.<a name="FNanchor_1164_1164" id="FNanchor_1164_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a></p>

<p>Melanchthon betrays a certain indecision in his answer to the
weighty question: Which faith is essential for salvation? At
one time he takes this faith, according to the common Lutheran
view, as trust in the mercy of God in Christ, at another, as assent
to the whole revealed Word of God. Of his Disputations, which
are the best witnesses we have to his attitude, the editor says
aptly: “He alternates between two definitions of faith which
he seems to consider of equal value, though to-day the difference
between them cannot fail to strike one. He wavers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
yet he does so quite unconsciously.”<a name="FNanchor_1165_1165" id="FNanchor_1165_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a> The same editor also
states that all attempts hitherto made to explain this phenomenon
leave something to be desired. He himself makes no such
attempt.</p>

<p>The true explanation, however, is not far to seek.</p>

<p>Melanchthon’s vacillation was the inevitable consequence of a
false doctrinal standpoint. According to the principles of Luther
and Melanchthon, faith, even as a mere assurance of salvation,
should of itself avail to save a man and therefore to make him a
member of the Church. Thus there is no longer any ground to
require a preliminary belief or obedient acceptance of the whole
substance of the Word of God; and yet some acceptance, at least
implicit, of the whole substance of revelation, seems required of
everyone who desires to be a Christian. This explains the efforts
of both Luther and Melanchthon to discover ways and means for
the reintroduction of this sort of faith. Their search was rendered
the more difficult by the fact that here there was a “work” in
the most real sense of the word, viz. willing, humble and cheerful
acceptance of the law, and readiness to accord a firm assent to
the truths revealed. The difficulty was even enhanced because in
the last resort an authority is required, particularly by the unlearned,
to formulate the doctrines and to point out what the
true content of revelation is. In point of fact, however, every
external guarantee of this sort had been discarded, at least
theoretically, and no human authority could provide such an
assurance. We seek in vain for a properly established authority
capable of enacting with binding power what has to be believed,
now that Luther and Melanchthon have rejected the idea of a
visible Church and hierarchy, vicariously representing Christ.
From this point of view it is easy to understand Melanchthon’s
efforts&mdash;illogical though they were&mdash;to erect an edifice of “pure
doctrine for all time” and his fondness for a “firm, hard and
rigid law of doctrine.” His perplexity and wavering were only
too natural. What reliable guarantee was Melanchthon in a
position to offer&mdash;he who so frequently altered his teaching&mdash;that
his own interpretation of Scripture exactly rendered the
Divine Revelation, and thus constituted “pure doctrine” firm
and unassailable? Modern theologians, when they find fault
with Melanchthon for his assumption of authority and for his
alteration of Luther’s teaching, have certainly some justification
for their strictures.<a name="FNanchor_1166_1166" id="FNanchor_1166_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, however, Luther, as we shall see below,
was every whit as undecided as Melanchthon as to what was to
be understood by faith. Like his friend, Luther too alternates
between faith as an assurance of salvation and faith as an assent
to the whole Word of God. The only difference is, that, in his
earlier years, his views concerning the freedom of each individual
Christian to expound the Word of God and to determine what
belonged to the body of faith, were much more radical than at a
later period.<a name="FNanchor_1167_1167" id="FNanchor_1167_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a> Hence Melanchthon’s fondness for a “rigid law of
doctrine” was more at variance with the earlier than with the
later Luther. From the later Luther he differs favourably in
this; not being under the necessity of having to explain away
any earlier radical views, he was better able to sum up more
clearly and systematically the essentials of belief, a task, moreover,
which appealed to his natural disposition. Luther’s ideas
on this subject are almost exclusively embodied in polemical
writings written under the stress of great excitement; such
statements only too frequently evince exaggerations of the worst
sort, due to the passion and heat of the moment.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Of special importance was Melanchthon’s opposition to
Luther on one of the most practical points of the Church’s
life, viz. the doctrine of the Supper. At the Table which
was intended to be the most sublime expression of the
charity and union prevailing among the faithful, these two
minds differed hopelessly.</p>

<p>It was useless for Luther to assure Melanchthon that the
Real Presence of Christ in the Sacrament was so essential
an article of faith that if a man did not believe in it he
believed in no article whatever. From the commencement
of the ‘thirties Melanchthon struck out his own course and
became ever more convinced, that the doctrine of the Real
Presence was not vouched for by the Bible. Once he had
gone so far as to tell the Zwinglians that they had “to fear
the punishment of Heaven” on account of their erroneous
doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_1168_1168" id="FNanchor_1168_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> After becoming acquainted with the “<i>Dialogus</i>”
of [Œcolampadius, published in 1530, he, however, veered
round to a denial of the Sacrament. Yet, with his superficial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
rationalism and his misinterpretation of certain patristic
statements, [Œcolampadius had really adduced no peremptory
objection against the general, traditional, literal
interpretation of the words of consecration to which Melanchthon,
as well as Luther, had till then adhered. In view of
Melanchthon’s defective theological education little was
needed to bring about an alteration in his views, particularly
when the alteration was in the direction of a Humanistic
softening of hard words, or seemed likely to provide a basis
for conciliation. There was some foundation for his comparison
of himself, in matters of theology, to the donkey
in the Palm-Sunday mystery-play.<a name="FNanchor_1169_1169" id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a></p>

<p>On the question of the Sacrament, the theory of the
“Sacramentarians” came more and more to seem to him
the true one.</p>

<p>Owing, however, to his timidity and the fear in which he
stood of Luther, he did not dare to speak out. The “<i>Loci</i>”
of 1535 is remarkably obscure in its teaching concerning the
Sacrament, whilst, in a letter to Camerarius of the same
year, he speaks of Luther’s view as “alien” to his own,
which, however, he refuses to explain.<a name="FNanchor_1170_1170" id="FNanchor_1170_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> Later the Cologne
scheme of 1543 in which Bucer, to Luther’s great annoyance,
evaded the question of the Real Presence, obtained Melanchthon’s
approval. When, in 1540, Melanchthon made public
a new edition of the Confession of Augsburg (“<i>Confessio
variata</i>”), containing alterations of greater import than
those of the previous editions, the new wording of the 10th
Article was “Melanchthonian” in the sense that it failed
to exclude “the doctrine either of Melanchthon, or of
Bucer, or of Calvin on the Supper.”<a name="FNanchor_1171_1171" id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> It was “Melanchthonian”
also in that elasticity and ambiguity which has
since become the model for so many Protestant formularies.
In order to secure a certain outward unity it became usual
to avoid any explicitness which might affright such as
happened to have scruples. A Melanchthonian character
was thus imparted to the theology which, with Melanchthon
himself as leader, was to guard the heritage of Luther.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Points of Accord between Melanchthon and Luther.</i></h4>

<p>Melanchthon’s religious character naturally exhibits many
points of contact with that of Luther.</p>

<p>Only to a limited extent, however, does this hold good of
the “inward terrors.” Attempts have been made to prove
that, like Luther, his more youthful friend believed he had
experienced within him the salutary working of the new
doctrine of Justification.<a name="FNanchor_1172_1172" id="FNanchor_1172_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> But, though, in his “<i>Apologia</i>”
to the Augsburg Confession and in other writings, he extols,
as we have seen, this doctrine as alone capable of imparting
strength and consolation in times of severe anxiety of
conscience and spiritual desolation, and though he speaks
of the “<i>certamina conscientiæ</i>,” and of the assurance of
salvation in exactly the same way that Luther does, still
this is no proof of his having experienced anything of the
sort himself. The statements, which might be adduced in
plenty from his private letters, lag very far behind Luther’s
characteristic assurances of his own experience.</p>

<p>Of the enlightenment from on high by which he believed
Luther’s divine mission as well as his own work as a teacher
to be the result, of prayer for their common cause and of
the joy in heaven over the work, labours and persecution
they had endured, he can speak in language as exalted as
his master’s, though not with quite the same wealth of
imagination and eloquence. That the Pope is Antichrist
he proves from the Prophet Daniel and other biblical
passages, with the same bitter prejudice and the same painstaking
exegesis as Luther. On hearing of the misshapen
monster, alleged to have been found dead in the Tiber near
Rome in 1496, his superstition led him to write a work
overflowing with hatred against the older Church in which
in all seriousness he expounded the meaning of the “Pope-Ass,”
and described every part of its body in detail. This
work was published, together with Luther’s on the Freiberg
“Monk-Calf.”<a name="FNanchor_1173_1173" id="FNanchor_1173_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a> Melanchthon there says: “The feminine
belly and breasts of the monster denote the Pope’s body,
viz. the Cardinals, Bishops, Priests, Monks, Students, and
such-like lascivious folk and gluttonous swine, for their life
is nothing but feeding and swilling, unchastity and luxury....
The fish scales on the arms, legs, and neck stand for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
the secular princes and lords” who “cling to the Pope
and his rule,” etc.<a name="FNanchor_1174_1174" id="FNanchor_1174_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a> This curious pamphlet ran through a
number of editions, nor did Melanchthon ever become
aware of its absurdity. As for Luther, in 1535 he wrote an
Appendix, entitled “Luther’s Amen to the Interpretation
of the Pope-Ass,” confirming his friend’s reading of the
portent. “Because the Divine Majesty,” so we there read,
“has Himself created and manifested it [the monstrosity],
the whole world ought rightly to tremble and be horror-struck.”<a name="FNanchor_1175_1175" id="FNanchor_1175_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a></p>

<p>In his fondness for the superstitions of astrology Melanchthon
went further than Luther, who refused to believe in the
influence of the planets on man’s destiny, and in the horoscopes
on which his companion set so much store. Both,
however, were at one in their acceptance of other superstitions,
notably of diabolical apparitions even of the
strangest kinds.<a name="FNanchor_1176_1176" id="FNanchor_1176_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a></p>

<p>On this subject we learn much hitherto unknown from
the “<i>Analecta</i>,” published by G. Loesche in 1892.<a name="FNanchor_1177_1177" id="FNanchor_1177_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a> Melanchthon,
for instance, relates that a doctor at Tübingen “kept
the devil in a bottle, as magicians are wont to do.”<a name="FNanchor_1178_1178" id="FNanchor_1178_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a> Amsdorf
had once heard the devil grunting. Melanchthon himself had
heard a tremendous noise on the roof of the cathedral at
Magdeburg, which was a presage of coming warlike disturbances;
the same portent had been observed at Wittenberg
previous to the besieging of the town.<a name="FNanchor_1179_1179" id="FNanchor_1179_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> To what extent
people might become tools of the devil was evident, so he
told his students, from the example of two witches at
Berlin, who had murdered a child in order to raise a snow-storm
by means of impious rites, and who were now awaiting
punishment at the hands of the authorities.<a name="FNanchor_1180_1180" id="FNanchor_1180_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a> It was not,
however, so easy to deal with witches. At Wittenberg one,
while undergoing torture on the rack, had changed herself
into a cat and mewed.<a name="FNanchor_1181_1181" id="FNanchor_1181_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a> Twelve years previously a ghost
had killed a fisherman on the Elster.<a name="FNanchor_1182_1182" id="FNanchor_1182_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a> Hence it was necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
to look out for good remedies and counter-spells
against witchcraft. “Where tortoises were to be met with
it was held that neither poison nor magic could work
any harm.”<a name="FNanchor_1183_1183" id="FNanchor_1183_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a></p>

<p>According to Melanchthon the signs in the heavens must
never be disregarded when studying the times. Two fiery
serpents, which had recently been seen at Eisenberg engaged
in a struggle in the sky, were an infallible presage of
“coming war in the Church,” especially as a fiery cross had
shown itself above the serpents.<a name="FNanchor_1184_1184" id="FNanchor_1184_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a> By careful calculations
he had ascertained that the end of the world, the approach
of which was in any case foretold by the wickedness of men,
would take place before the year 1582.<a name="FNanchor_1185_1185" id="FNanchor_1185_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a></p>

<p>His friend Camerarius remarked with annoyance that
“many persons had made notes of Melanchthon’s private
conversations and thus affixed a stigma to his name.”<a name="FNanchor_1186_1186" id="FNanchor_1186_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a>
This complaint reminds us of a drollery, none too delicate,
contained in the “<i>Analecta</i>” among the “<i>Dicta Melanchthonis</i>”
concerning the flatulence of a monk.<a name="FNanchor_1187_1187" id="FNanchor_1187_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a> Even the
editor admits that one cannot think very highly of these
sayings of Melanchthon, especially when we remember that
the “<i>Dicta</i>” were uttered at lectures which the speaker
seemed in the habit of enlivening with all kinds of examples
and vulgarities. He adds, “Our discovery reveals the
very low standard of the lectures then delivered at the
University.”</p>

<p>Loesche also remarks that “these Dicta have contributed
to destroy the legend of Melanchthon’s gentleness and
kindliness.”<a name="FNanchor_1188_1188" id="FNanchor_1188_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">In connection with the legend of his kindliness, Loesche refers
to a remark made by Melanchthon, according to the “<i>Dicta</i>,”
about the year 1553: “Whoever murders a tyrant, as did those
who murdered N. in Lithuania, offers a holocaust to God.”<a name="FNanchor_1189_1189" id="FNanchor_1189_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> Such
views regarding the lawfulness of murdering tyrants he seems to
have derived from his study of the classics. He had, moreover,
already given expression to them long before this, referring to
Henry VIII. of England, who had ceased to favour the Reformation
as conducted in Germany. In a letter to his friend Veit
Dietrich he wishes, that God would send a brave assassin to rid
the world of the tyrant.<a name="FNanchor_1190_1190" id="FNanchor_1190_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>Melanchthon was in reality far from tolerant, and in his
demands for the punishment of heretics he went to great lengths.
It is generally known how he gave it as his opinion, in 1557, that
the execution of the Spanish doctor, Michael Servetus, which
took place at Geneva in 1553 at the instance of Calvin, was a
“pious and memorable example for posterity.”<a name="FNanchor_1191_1191" id="FNanchor_1191_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> He wrote to
Calvin, on October 14, 1554, concerning the proceedings against
Servetus, who had denied the Trinity as well as the divinity of
Christ, as follows: “I agree entirely with your sentence; I also
declare that your authorities have acted wisely and justly in
putting this blasphemous man to death.”<a name="FNanchor_1192_1192" id="FNanchor_1192_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a> When the severity of
the step was blamed by some, he expressed his surprise at the
objectors in a letter of August 20, 1555, to Bullinger at Zürich,
and sent him a little treatise defending and recommending
similar sentences.<a name="FNanchor_1193_1193" id="FNanchor_1193_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> He there proves that false doctrines should
be treated as notorious blasphemies, and that the secular authorities
were accordingly bound by the Divine law to punish them
with the utmost severity; Divine chastisements were to be
apprehended should the authorities, out of a false sense of pity,
show themselves remiss in extirpating erroneous doctrines. Such
was indeed the teaching at Wittenberg, as evinced, for instance,
by a disputation at the University, where Melanchthon’s friend
and colleague, George Major, branded the contrary opinion as
“impudent and abominable.”<a name="FNanchor_1194_1194" id="FNanchor_1194_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a></p>

<p>Characteristic of Melanchthon, though hitherto little noticed,
were the severity and obstinacy with which he sought to carry
his intolerance into practice. He relentlessly called in the assistance
of the secular authorities against the canons of Cologne who
had remained faithful to the religion of their fathers.<a name="FNanchor_1195_1195" id="FNanchor_1195_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> As to his
opponents within his own fold he demanded that the rulers
should punish them, particularly the Anabaptists, not merely as
sedition-mongers and rebels, but on account of their doctrinal
peculiarities. Their rejection of infant baptism he regarded as
one of those blasphemies which ought to be punished by death;
the denial of original sin and the theory that the Sacraments were
merely signs he looked upon as similar blasphemies. At least
those Anabaptists, “who are the heads and leaders,” and who
refuse to abjure their errors, “should be put to death by the
sword as seditious men and blasphemers.” “Others, who have
been led astray, and who, though not so defiant, refuse to recant,
should be treated as madmen and sent to jail.”<a name="FNanchor_1196_1196" id="FNanchor_1196_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>Of these principles concerning the coercion of both Catholics
and sectarians we have an enduring memorial in Melanchthon’s
work dated 1539, and entitled “On the office of Princes.”<a name="FNanchor_1197_1197" id="FNanchor_1197_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a> Nor
did he fail to incite the Lutheran authorities to adopt, in the
interests of public worship, coercive measures against negligent
Protestants: “I should be pleased were the authorities to make
a stringent rule of driving the people to church, particularly on
holidays.”<a name="FNanchor_1198_1198" id="FNanchor_1198_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a></p>

<p>His fondness for the use of coercion in furthering his own
religious views is apparent throughout his career, and how
congenial it was to him is clear from the fact that he manifested
this leaning at the very outset of the reforms at Wittenberg, even
before Luther had seen his way to do the same.</p>

<p>As early as October 20, 1521, subsequent to the changes in
public worship which had been effected by the apostate Augustinians
supported by some Wittenberg professors such as Carlstadt,
Amsdorf, and Jonas, Melanchthon in a written admonition
told the Elector, that, as a Christian Prince, he should “make
haste to abrogate the abuse of the Mass” in his country and
principality, unmindful of the calumnies to which this might
give rise, “in order that your Electoral Highness may not, like
Capharnaum, be reproached by Christ on the Last Day on
account of the great grace and mercy which, without any work
of ours, has been shown in your Electoral Highness’s lands, the
Holy Evangel being revealed, manifested, and brought to light,
and yet all to no purpose”; God would require at his hands an
account for the great grace of Luther’s mission.<a name="FNanchor_1199_1199" id="FNanchor_1199_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a></p>

<p>In this admonition, brimful of the most bitter prejudice, we
find for the first time the principle laid down, that the “salvation
of his soul required of a Christian Prince” the prohibition of
the olden Catholic worship.</p>

<p>In point of fact Melanchthon was frequently ahead of Luther
in carrying the latter’s theories to their logical conclusion, utterly
regardless of rights infringed. Thus, for instance, he was before
Luther in reaching the conclusion that religious vows were
invalid.</p></div>

<p class="p1">The conviction and enthusiasm with which, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
very outset, he took Luther’s side was due, as he repeatedly
avers, to motives of a moral and religious order; he backed
up Luther, so he assures us, because he hoped thereby to
promote a reform of morals. “I am conscious of having
taken up the study of theology for no other reason than to
amend our lives.”<a name="FNanchor_1200_1200" id="FNanchor_1200_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a> What he here states as a young man of
twenty-eight, he made use of to console and encourage
himself with later. What he had in mind was, of course, the
ostensibly hopeless decline of morals under Popery. This
he painted in vivid colours borrowed from Luther, for he
himself had never come into any such close contact with the
abuses as would have enabled him to reach a reliable and
independent opinion of his own. Having thoroughly aroused
his hatred of the Papacy and convinced himself of the
urgent necessity of combating the vicious decadence and
intellectual darkness brought into the world by Antichrist,
he is wont to depict the ideal of his own thoughts and
efforts; this was the “<i>disciplina et obedientia populi Dei</i>” to
be achieved by means of an education at once religious and
Humanistic.</p>

<h3>3. Melanchthon at the Zenith of His Career.<br />
His Mental Sufferings</h3>

<p>Various traits of Melanchthon already alluded to may
serve favourably to impress the unbiassed reader, even
though his views be different. We now proceed to sum
these up, supplementing them by a few other details of a
similar nature.</p>

<h4><i>Favourable Traits.</i></h4>

<p>The many touching and heartfelt complaints concerning
the moral disorders prevalent in the Protestant Churches
are peculiar to Melanchthon. Luther, it is true, also
regretted them, but his regret is harshly expressed and
he is disposed to lay the blame on the wrong shoulders.
Melanchthon, with his praiseworthy concern for discipline
and ordered doctrine, was naturally filled with deep misgivings
when the preaching of the Evangel resulted in
moral disorder and waywardness in views and doctrine.
This explains why he was so ready to turn to the authorities
to implore their assistance in establishing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
stable, Christian government which was his ideal. (Below,
p. 372 f.)</p>

<p>Above all, he was desirous of seeing the foundations of the
Empire and the rights of the Emperor safeguarded, so long
as the new Evangel was not endangered. None of those who
thought as he did at Wittenberg were more anxious lest the
religious movement should jeopardise the peace; in none of
them is the sense of responsibility so marked as in Melanchthon.
Being by nature as well as by education less strong-hearted
than Luther, he was not so successful as the latter
in repressing his misery at the consequences of his position.
To this his correspondence, which is full of interest and
characteristic of his moods, is a striking witness.</p>

<p>Yet, amidst all the complaints we find in these letters,
we hardly come across any statement concerning personal
troubles of conscience. As a layman, he had not to reproach
himself with any apostasy from the sacred office of the
priesthood. Unlike Luther and his other friends, from his
youth upward his studies and his profession had not been
ecclesiastical. The others had once been religious or priests
and had, by their marriage, violated a strict law of the
Church, which was not the case with him.</p>

<p>His fine mental powers he devoted to the service of
Humanism, seeking to promote the cause of education,
particularly at the University of Wittenberg, but also elsewhere,
by his many-sided writings in the domain of worldly
learning and culture. We need only recall his works on
rhetoric and grammar, on the ancient philosophy, more
particularly the Aristotelian, on dialectics, ethics, and
psychology. Such works from his ready but careful pen
created for him a great and permanent field of activity, and
at the same time helped to distract him amidst the sad
realities of life and his own bitter experiences. He openly
declared his preference for Humanistic studies, stating that
he had been drawn into the theological controversies quite
against his will.</p>

<p>It was to his philosophic mode of thought that he owed
the self-control which he possessed in so remarkable a
degree. Often we are put in mind of the stoic when we hear
him, the scholar, giving the soft answer to the insults heaped
on him in his own circle and then quietly proceeding on his
own way. And yet his character was irritable and prone to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
passionate anger, as on one occasion some lazy students at
the University learnt to their cost. Hence his moderation
in his dealings with his Wittenberg colleagues is all the
more remarkable.</p>

<p>In his family life Melanchthon has been described as a
model of industry, love of order and domesticity. He rose
before daybreak in order to deal with his large correspondence;
his letters, full of sympathy for friends and those who
stood in need of help, were carefully written, and usually
couched in Latin. German he did not write so fluently as
Luther. In his Latin letters to Humanist friends he often
drops into Greek, particularly when anxious to conceal
anything, for instance, when he has to complain of Luther.
His intimate and friendly intercourse with kindred spirits,
such as Camerarius, is a pleasing trait in his character; not
less so is the benevolence and unselfishness his letters attest,
which indeed he often carried so far as to deprive himself of
the needful. His home life was a happy one and his children
were well brought up, though his son-in-law, Sabinus, a
man of great talent, caused him much grief by his want of
conjugal fidelity, which was a source of scandal to the
family and also damaged the reputation of Wittenberg.</p>

<h4><i>Melanchthon’s Relations with Luther.</i></h4>

<p>In Melanchthon’s mental history, no less than in the
external circumstances of his life, stands out prominently,
his connection with Luther, of which we have already
recounted the beginnings.</p>

<p>The remarkable relations existing between Melanchthon
and Luther abound in psychological traits characteristic
of both. So intimate were they that others of the party
were disposed to see in their friendship the excellent working
of the evangelical spirit, the harmony and union of
mind of the two most eminent leaders of the new movement.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">To Melanchthon Luther’s higher mission was as good as proved
(above pp. 322, 355). To Capito he declared: “I am convinced
that he carries out his work not merely with prudence but with
the best of consciences, since he appears to have been destined
by God for this purpose; for never could one man carry so many
along with him unless he were animated by the Spirit of God.
He has not acted harshly towards any, save some of the sophists,
and even had he done so, we must remember that in our times a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
sharp tongue is needed, since he is the first who has preached
the Gospel for a long while. Leave him to the working of his own
spirit and resist not the will of God! This matter must not be
judged by human standards. The Gospel is proclaimed that it
may be an offence to the godless and that the sheep of Israel may
return to their God.”<a name="FNanchor_1201_1201" id="FNanchor_1201_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a></p>

<p>Thus Melanchthon in 1521. We may compare the promises
Luther held out to those who were filled with faith to his own
happy expectations of the outcome of his relations with Melanchthon:
“There, faith sets to work with joy and charity,” “to serve
others and to be helpful to them”; the consoling words of
St. Paul (Phil. ii. 1 ff.) were being fulfilled in brotherly unity,
“consolation in Christ, comfort of charity, society of the spirit,
bowels of commiseration,” and the result would be a “free,
willing, happy life”; “when the heart thus hears the voice of
Christ, it must be joyful and receive entire consolation.”<a name="FNanchor_1202_1202" id="FNanchor_1202_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">In Melanchthon’s case, however, these promises were not
realised in the event; on the contrary, inward disappointment
and mental suffering were increasingly to become his
portion.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Between 1528 and 1530 he openly admitted that he was
burdened with cares and troubles beyond measure, and only
consoled himself with the thought that the Day of Judgment
must be at the door. He was suffering all the pangs of hell on
account of the sights he was forced to witness, and would much
rather die than continue to suffer; the state of ecclesiastical
affairs caused him unspeakable pain, and not a day passed
that he did not long for death.<a name="FNanchor_1203_1203" id="FNanchor_1203_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a> Complaints such as these are to
be found in his correspondence till the very end of his life, so that
his most recent Protestant biographer speaks of his letters, more
particularly those to Camerarius, as witnessing to the “anxiety,
misery and profound mental suffering” which “consumed him”;
he also alludes to the “wine trodden out with such bitter pain”
which posterity enjoys, thanks to his labours. “Most of these
productions [the letters to Camerarius] it is impossible to read
without feeling the deepest sympathy.” “Even his severest
accuser will assuredly be disarmed when he sees what Melanchthon
suffered.”<a name="FNanchor_1204_1204" id="FNanchor_1204_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a></p>

<p>At the commencement of the ‘thirties he bewails his “unhappy
fate” which had entangled him in religious disputes,<a name="FNanchor_1205_1205" id="FNanchor_1205_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a>
and, seven years later, we have this startling confession: “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
cruel dolours of soul which I have endured for three years on end,
and the other cares which each day brings, have wasted me to
such an extent that I fear I cannot live much longer.”<a name="FNanchor_1206_1206" id="FNanchor_1206_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a> In the
next decade we have another confession to the same effect: “I
shall not be sorry to leave this prison (‘<i>ergastulum</i>’) when he
[Luther, whom Melanchthon here calls ‘<i>infestus</i>’] throws me
over.”<a name="FNanchor_1207_1207" id="FNanchor_1207_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">The various stages of his unhappy life, the outward influences
under which he came and many other accompanying
circumstances, are now known from various sources.</p>

<p>As early as 1523 and 1524 Melanchthon began to free
himself to some extent from the spell cast over him by his
domineering friend. He was in the first instance repelled by
the coarseness of Luther’s literary style, and also by much
which seemed to him exaggerated in his ways, more particularly
by his denial of free-will. (Above, p. 346 f.) The
sensitive nature of Melanchthon also took offence at certain
things in Luther’s private life, and his own observations
were confirmed by the sharp eyes of his bosom friend
Camerarius (Joachim Kammermeister), who had migrated
to Wittenberg in 1522. Their exchange of secret confidences
concerning Wittenberg affairs is unmistakable. Melanchthon
felt very lonely after the departure of Camerarius and
missed the stimulating intellectual intercourse at Wittenberg,
which had become a necessity to him. Frequently he complains,
even as early as 1524, that he met with no sympathy,
and sometimes he does not exclude even Luther. At
Wittenberg he felt like a lame cobbler.<a name="FNanchor_1208_1208" id="FNanchor_1208_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a> “There is no one
amongst my comrades and friends whose conversation
appeals to me. All the others [Luther is here excepted]
have no time for me, or else they belong to the common
herd (‘<i>vulgus sunt</i>’).”<a name="FNanchor_1209_1209" id="FNanchor_1209_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a> Any real friendship was out of the
question at the University, since there were no kindred
spirits; his intimacies were mere “wolves’ friendships,”<a name="FNanchor_1210_1210" id="FNanchor_1210_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
use an expression of Plato’s. He envies, so he says, those
who were surrounded by studious pupils and could devote
all their energies to study, far from the turmoil of religious
controversy.</p>

<p>The letter of censure which he wrote on Luther’s marriage
is a strange mixture of annoyance that this step should be
taken at so critical a juncture, of displeasure at Luther’s
thoughtless buffoonery and frivolous behaviour, and, on
the other hand, of forbearance, nay, admiration, for
the man who, in other respects, still appeared to him so
great. “That his friends [Melanchthon and Camerarius]
had privately criticised Luther’s behaviour is proved beyond
a doubt from a remark in the letter on Luther’s
marriage.”<a name="FNanchor_1211_1211" id="FNanchor_1211_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a></p>

<p>The contrast between their wives was also unfavourable to
the amity existing between Luther and Melanchthon. The
daughter of the Burgomaster of Wittenberg, Catherine
Krapp, whom Melanchthon had married, seems to have
been a rather haughty patrician, who was disposed to look
down on Catherine von Bora, whose family, though aristocratic,
had fallen on evil days. In a letter of a friend of
Luther the “tyranny of women” is once referred to as a
disturbing factor, and the context shows that the complaint
was drawn forth by Melanchthon’s wife and not by
Bora.<a name="FNanchor_1212_1212" id="FNanchor_1212_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a></p>

<p>Melanchthon’s troubles were, however, mostly caused by
the differences, literary and theological, which sprang up
between Luther and himself, and by his experiences and
disappointments in Church matters and questions of
conscience.</p>

<p>Luther’s violent and incautious manner of proceeding
led him to surmise, to his great regret, that many had
attached themselves to the cause of the innovations merely
from a desire for the freedom of the flesh, and that the
rising against the older Church had let loose a whole current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
of base elements.<a name="FNanchor_1213_1213" id="FNanchor_1213_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a> The virulence with which Luther
attacked everything could, in Melanchthon’s opinion, only
tend to alienate the better sort, i.e. the very people whose
help was essential to the carrying out of any real reform.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">As early as 1525 he began to find fault with Luther’s too
turbulent ways. In 1526, on the appearance of Erasmus’s
“<i>Hyperaspistes</i>,” the scholar’s incisive and brilliant rejoinder
to Luther’s “<i>De servo Arbitrio</i>,” Melanchthon feared some
unhappy outbreak, and, accordingly, he urgently begged the
latter to keep silence in the interests of truth and justice, which
he thought to be more likely on the side of Erasmus. To
Camerarius he wrote, on April 11, 1526: “Oh, that Luther
would hold his tongue! I had hoped that advancing years and
his experience of the prevailing evils would have quietened him,
but now I see that he is growing even more violent (‘<i>subinde
vehementiorem fieri</i>’) in every struggle into which he enters. This
causes me great pain.”<a name="FNanchor_1214_1214" id="FNanchor_1214_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a> Erasmus himself he assured later by
letter, that he had “never made any secret of this at Wittenberg,”
i.e. of his displeasure at the tracts Luther had published against
the great Humanist, for one reason “because they were not
conducive to the public welfare.”<a name="FNanchor_1215_1215" id="FNanchor_1215_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a></p>

<p>It was inevitable that a certain coolness should spring up
between them, for though Melanchthon was supple enough to be
cautious in his personal dealings with Luther, yet there can be
no doubt that many of his strictures duly reached the ears of his
friend. The more determined Lutherans, such as Aquila and
Amsdorf, even formed a party to thwart his plans.<a name="FNanchor_1216_1216" id="FNanchor_1216_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a> Melanchthon
also complains of opponents at the Court. Those who had been
dissatisfied with his doings at the Visitation “fanned the flames
at Court,” and so much did he suffer through these intrigues that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
according to a later statement of his, his “life was actually in
danger” (“<i>ut vita mea in discrimen veniret</i>”).<a name="FNanchor_1217_1217" id="FNanchor_1217_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a></p>

<p>So greatly was he overwhelmed that, in 1527, he even declared
he would rather his son should die than occupy a position of
such sore anxiety as his own.<a name="FNanchor_1218_1218" id="FNanchor_1218_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a></p>

<p>In spite of the growing independence displayed by Melanchthon,
Luther continued to show him the greatest consideration and
forbearance, and even to heap literary praise on him, as he did,
for instance, in his Preface to Melanchthon’s very mediocre
Exposition of the Epistle to the Colossians.<a name="FNanchor_1219_1219" id="FNanchor_1219_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a> He was all the
more set on attaching Melanchthon to himself and his cause by
such eulogies, because he dreaded lest his comrade’s preference
for his Humanistic labours should one day deprive the new
faith of his so powerful support.</p>

<p>The command of the Elector was afterwards to send the
learned but timid man to the Diets, notwithstanding that he
was quite unsuited for political labours on the great stage of the
world. We know already what his feelings were at Spires and
then again at Augsburg. His most recent biographer says of the
earlier Diet: “The depression induced in him by the Protest of
Spires and the growth of Zwinglianism, increased still more
during his journey home and the first days after his return; he
felt profoundly downcast and looked forward to the future with
the utmost anxiety. From his standpoint he certainly had good
reason for his fear.”<a name="FNanchor_1220_1220" id="FNanchor_1220_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a> At Augsburg he suffered so much that
Luther wrote to him: “You torment yourself without respite....
It is not theology, however, which torments you but your
philosophy, and therefore your fears are groundless.”<a name="FNanchor_1221_1221" id="FNanchor_1221_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a> And
later: “I have been through greater inward torments than I
trust you will ever experience, and such as I would not wish any
man, not even our bitterest opponents there. And yet, amidst
such troubles, I have often been cheered up by the words of a
brother, for instance, Pomeranus, yourself, Jonas, or some other.
Hence, why not listen to us, who speak to you, not according to
the flesh or world, but undoubtedly according to God and the
Holy Ghost?” But you prefer to lean on your philosophy; “Led
away by your reason you act according to your own foolishness
and are killing yourself ... whereas this matter is really
beyond us and must be left to God.” Luther felt convinced that
his “prayer for Melanchthon was most certainly being answered.”<a name="FNanchor_1222_1222" id="FNanchor_1222_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">The hope that Melanchthon would get the better of his
depression after the momentous Diet was over was only
partially realised.</p>

<p>The conviction that there was no chance of reunion with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
the existing Church, which he had reached at Augsburg,
pierced him to the depths of his soul. “In his quality of
theologian,” says Kawerau, “the thought of the Church’s
oneness caused him to endure the bitterest agonies, particularly
between 1530 and 1532”; if certain of the
Catholic leaders sought to draw him over to their side,
there was “some justification for their attempts,” to be
accounted for by the impression he had given at Augsburg,
viz. of not being quite at home among the Evangelicals.<a name="FNanchor_1223_1223" id="FNanchor_1223_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a>
What seemed to confirm this impression, adds Kawerau,
was “that Melanchthon in his printed, and still more in his
epistolary communications, repeatedly gave occasion to
people to think that it might be worth while approaching
him with fresh proposals of conciliation.”<a name="FNanchor_1224_1224" id="FNanchor_1224_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a></p>

<p>Of the psychological struggle hinted at by Kawerau,
through which he, who, after Luther, was the chief promoter
of the innovations, had to pass, it is possible to gain many a
glimpse from contemporary documents.</p>

<p>The wrong idea which he came more and more to cherish
amounted to this: The true doctrine of the Catholic Church
of Christ, as against the <i>Roman</i> Catholic Church of the day,
is that to be found “in the Epistles of the Apostles and in
the recognised ecclesiastical writers.”<a name="FNanchor_1225_1225" id="FNanchor_1225_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a> Without succeeding
in finding any position of real safety, he insists on the
necessity of sharing the “consensus of the Catholic Church
of Christ” and of belonging to the true, ancient and
“sublime ‘<i>cœtus ecclesiæ</i>’ over which rules the Son of God.”<a name="FNanchor_1226_1226" id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a>
Hence comes what we find in the Wittenberg certificates of
Ordination which he drew up, in which the “<i>doctrina
catholicæ ecclesiæ</i>,” taken, of course, in the above uncertain
and wholly subjective sense, is declared to have been
accepted by the “<i>ordinandi</i>” and to be the best testimony
to their office. In this conception of the Church “we find
the explanation of the great struggle which it cost him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
when, after 1530, he had to face the fact that the schism
was real and definitive.... In his conception, the true
faith was thus no longer the new Lutheran understanding
of the Gospel, but rather the ancient creeds.”<a name="FNanchor_1227_1227" id="FNanchor_1227_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Cordatus was not so far wrong when he declared, referring to
Melanchthon, that at Wittenberg there were men “learned in
languages who would rather read and listen to a dead Erasmus
than a living Luther.”<a name="FNanchor_1228_1228" id="FNanchor_1228_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a></p>

<p>Erasmus himself saw in Melanchthon’s exposition of Romans
and in the dedication of the same which the author privately
sent him on October 25, 1532, a “clear corroboration of the
suspicion that he had come to dislike his own party” (“<i>se suorum
pigere</i>”).<a name="FNanchor_1229_1229" id="FNanchor_1229_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a> In the aforesaid dedication Melanchthon had complained,
as he often did, of the religious “controversies and
quarrels” which were quite repugnant to him: “As neither side
cares for moderation, both have refused to listen to us.” These
and such-like admissions “caused Erasmus to think that he was
desirous of forsaking the evangelical camp.”<a name="FNanchor_1230_1230" id="FNanchor_1230_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a> In the very year
of Erasmus’s death he wrote to him: “I cordially agree with
you on most of the questions under discussion.”<a name="FNanchor_1231_1231" id="FNanchor_1231_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a> The fondness
of the Wittenbergers for the crude and paradoxical, so he adds,
discreetly veiling his meaning in Greek, failed entirely to appeal
to him; he was anxious to find “better-sounding” formulæ in
which to embody doctrine, but here he was faced by “danger.”
He bad reached an age when lie had learnt to treat questions of
faith more gingerly than of yore.<a name="FNanchor_1232_1232" id="FNanchor_1232_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a> “Thus, in the presence of
Erasmus, he here repudiates the Melanchthon of the early years
of the Reformation.”<a name="FNanchor_1233_1233" id="FNanchor_1233_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a></p>

<p>At Wittenberg there was then a rumour that Melanchthon
intended to migrate elsewhere, because he no longer agreed with
Luther and his set.<a name="FNanchor_1234_1234" id="FNanchor_1234_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a> That such was actually his intention has
since been confirmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>Only in 1900 was a letter unearthed&mdash;written by Melanchthon
in this critical period (1532), to Andreas Cricius, Catholic bishop
of Plozk, and an ardent Humanist&mdash;in which he deplores in
touching language the “unhappy fate” which had embroiled
him in the religious “quarrels.”<a name="FNanchor_1235_1235" id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a> In the beginning he had taken
part in the movement started by Luther under the impression
that “certain points connected with piety would be emphasised,
and this had, all along, been his object”; his efforts had ever
been to “moderate” and to “put an end to controversy”;
he also exerted himself “to vindicate the importance of the
Church’s constitution.”<a name="FNanchor_1236_1236" id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a> He expresses his readiness to accept
a post of professor which the Bishop might see fit to offer, in which
he might find a refuge from the storms at Wittenberg: “If you
will point out to me a haven of refuge where I can promote and
advance the learning so dear to us both, and in which I have
acquired some little proficiency, then I will submit to your
authority.” In the same letter, however, he points out that he
could never approve of the “cruelty of the opponents” of the
Protestant cause, nor would the public decision to be expected
fall out in accordance with their ideas; yet neither did he agree
with those who wished to destroy the substance of the Church.
Cricius appears to have pointed out to him, in a letter now no
longer extant, that, before he, the Bishop, could do anything it
would be necessary for Melanchthon to sever his connection with
the Evangelicals. This he could not bring himself to do. “If
you have a more feasible proposal to make, then I will accept
it as a Divine call.”<a name="FNanchor_1237_1237" id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>Shortly before this, on January 31, 1532, Melanchthon had
expressed the wish to Duke Magnus of Mecklenburg, on the
occasion of the re-establishment of the University of Rostock,
that a “quiet spot might be found for him,” lamenting that his
time was taken up in matters “altogether repugnant to my
character and the learned labours I have ever loved.”<a name="FNanchor_1238_1238" id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a></p>

<p>Hence there is no doubt that, at that time, utterly sick of his
work at Luther’s side, he was perfectly ready to change his
lodgings. “It was a joyless life that Melanchthon led at Wittenberg.
His admiration for Luther was indeed not dead, but
mutual trust was wanting.”<a name="FNanchor_1239_1239" id="FNanchor_1239_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a></p>

<p>In 1536 the repressed discontent of the ultra-Lutherans broke
out into open persecution of Melanchthon. At the head of his
assailants was Conrad Cordatus, who had sniffed heresy in the
stress Melanchthon laid on the will and on man’s co-operation in
the work of Justification; his first step was to begin a controversy
with Cruciger, Melanchthon’s friend.<a name="FNanchor_1240_1240" id="FNanchor_1240_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a> At about that time,
Luther, in his annoyance with Melanchthon, declared: “I am
willing enough to admit Master Philip’s proficiency in the
sciences and in philosophy, nothing more; but, with God’s help,
I shall have to chop off the head of philosophy, for so it must be.”<a name="FNanchor_1241_1241" id="FNanchor_1241_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a>
Nevertheless, to retain the indispensable support of so great a
scholar and to preserve peace at the University, Luther preferred
to seek a compromise, on the occasion of a solemn Disputation
held on June 1, 1537. At the same time, it is true, he
characterised the thesis on the “necessity of good works for
salvation” as reprehensible and misleading.<a name="FNanchor_1242_1242" id="FNanchor_1242_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a></p>

<p>Further difficulties were raised in 1537 by Pastor Jacob
Schenk, who would have it that Melanchthon had made treasonable
concessions in the interests of the Catholics in the matter of
the giving of the chalice. This strained still further his relations
with Luther, who had already long been dimly suspicious of
Melanchthon’s Zwinglian leanings concerning the Supper. The
Elector, who was also vexed, consulted Luther privately concerning
Melanchthon; Luther, however, again expressed his
regard for him, and deprecated his “being driven from the
University,” adding, nevertheless, that, should he seek to assert
his opinion on the Supper, then “God’s truth would have to be
put first.”<a name="FNanchor_1243_1243" id="FNanchor_1243_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a></p>

<p>The intervention of the Elector in this case, and, generally, the
interference of the great Lords in ecclesiastical affairs&mdash;which frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
marred his plans for conciliation&mdash;embittered him more
and more as years passed.</p>

<p>He was perfectly aware that the influential patrons of the
innovations were animated by mere egoism, avarice and lust
for power. “The rulers have martyred me so long,” he once
declared, “that I have no wish to go on living amid such suffering.”<a name="FNanchor_1244_1244" id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Yet Melanchthon’s own inclination was more and more
in the direction of leaving ecclesiastical affairs to the secular
authorities. In his practice he abandoned the idea of an
invisible Church even more completely than did Luther.
The rigid doctrinal system for which he came to stand in the
interests of the pure preaching of the faith, the duty which
he assigned to the State of seeing that the proclamation of
the Gospel conformed to the standard of the Augsburg
Confession, and finally the countenance he gave to the
persecution of sectarians by the State, and to State regulation
of the Church, all this showed that he was anxious to
make of the Church a mere department of the State.<a name="FNanchor_1245_1245" id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> The
Princes, as principal members of the Church, must, according
to him, see “that errors are removed and consciences
comforted”; above all they were of course to assist in
“checking the encroachments of the Popes.”<a name="FNanchor_1246_1246" id="FNanchor_1246_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a> “To us at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
the present day it appears strange&mdash;though at the time of
the Reformation this was not felt at all&mdash;that Melanchthon,
in the Article of the Augsburg Confession concerning
priestly marriage, should have [in the ‘<i>Variata</i>’] made the
appeal to the Emperor so comprehensive that the ecclesiastical
privileges of the Princes practically became an
article of faith.”<a name="FNanchor_1247_1247" id="FNanchor_1247_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a></p>

<p>It also displeased him greatly that Luther in his writings
should so frequently employ vile and abusive epithets when
speaking of great persons. He was loath to see the Catholic
Princes thus vilified, particularly when, as in the case of
Albert, Elector of Mayence, he had hopes of their assistance.
On June 16, 1538, Luther read aloud from the pulpit, and
afterwards published in print, a statement of “frightful
violence” against this Prince, moved thereto, as it would
appear, by the respectful manner in which the Archbishop
had been treated by Melanchthon.<a name="FNanchor_1248_1248" id="FNanchor_1248_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a> The latter made no
secret of his entire disapproval, and it is to be hoped that
others at Wittenberg shared his opinion of this document
in which Luther speaks of the German Prince as a false and
perjured man, town-clerk and merd-bishop of Halle.<a name="FNanchor_1249_1249" id="FNanchor_1249_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a></p>

<p>The fact is, however, that it was in many instances
Melanchthon’s own pusillanimity and too great deference
to the Protestant Princes which caused him to sanction
things which afterwards he regretted. For instance, we
hear him complaining, when alluding to the cruelty of
Henry VIII. of England, of the “terrible wounds” inflicted
on him by a “tyrant.” The “tyrant” to whom he here
refers was the bigamist, Philip of Hesse. Melanchthon had
been too compliant in the case of both these sovereigns.
When Henry VIII., who had fallen out with his spouse, made
overtures to the Wittenbergers, it was Melanchthon, who,
in view of the king’s desire to contract a fresh marriage,
suggested he might take a second wife. Concerning Philip
of Hesse’s bigamy he had at the outset had scruples, but
he set them aside from the following motive which he himself
alleged not long after: “For Philip threatened to
apostatise unless we should assist him.”<a name="FNanchor_1250_1250" id="FNanchor_1250_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a> His conscience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
had reason enough to complain of the “terrible wounds”
inflicted upon it by this tyrant, but for this Melanchthon
himself was answerable. He even assisted personally at the
marriage of the second wife, though, possibly, his presence
was secured by means of a stratagem. When later, he, even
more than his friends, was troubled with remorse concerning
his part in the business&mdash;especially when the Landgrave,
wilfully and “tyrannically,” threatened the theologians
with the publication of their permission&mdash;he fell a prey to a
deadly sickness, due primarily to the depth of his grief and
shame. Luther hastened to Weimar where he lay and,
in spite of his own depression, by the brave face he put on,
and also by his loving care, was able to console the stricken
man so that he ultimately recovered. “Martin,” so Melanchthon
gratefully declared, “saved me from the jaws of
death.”<a name="FNanchor_1251_1251" id="FNanchor_1251_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a></p>

<p>By Philip of Hesse, Melanchthon had once before been
taken to task over a falsehood of his. It had fallen to
Melanchthon to draw up a memorandum, dispatched on
September 1, 1538, by the Elector Johann Frederick and the
Landgrave Philip, conjointly, to King Henry VIII. of
England. In the draft, which was submitted to both
Princes, he asserted, contrary to the real state of the case,
that, in Germany, there were no Anabaptists “in those
districts where the pure doctrine of the Gospel is preached,”
though they were to be found “where this doctrine is not
preached”; this he wrote though he himself had assisted
Luther previously in drawing up memoranda for localities
in the immediate vicinity of Wittenberg, directed against
the Anabaptists established there in the very bosom of the
new Church. The Landgrave refused to agree to such a
misrepresentation, even for the sake of predisposing King
Henry for Lutheranism. He candidly informed the Elector
that he did not agree with this passage, “for there are
Anabaptists in those parts of Germany where the pure
Gospel is preached just as much as in those where it is not
rightly preached.” In consequence the passage in question
was left out, merely a general reference to the existence of
Anabaptists in Germany being allowed to remain.<a name="FNanchor_1252_1252" id="FNanchor_1252_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>The following example likewise shows how Melanchthon’s
want of uprightness and firmness contributed to raise
difficulties and unpleasantness with those in power. Johann
Frederick of Saxony seized upon the bishopric of Naumburg-Zeitz,
and, in spite of the Emperor’s warning, caused
Amsdorf to be “consecrated” its bishop. The Wittenbergers,
including Melanchthon, had given their sanction
to this step. Afterwards, however, the latter was overwhelmed
with scruples. “Tyranny has increased more and
more at the Courts,” exclaimed Melanchthon.&mdash;“There is
no doubt that his sense of responsibility in a proceeding,
which he had been driven to sanction against his better
judgment, depressed him.” He trembled at the thought
that “the matter might well lead to warlike entanglements,
and that the Emperor would resent as an insult and never
forget this violent seizure of the highest spiritual principalities.”<a name="FNanchor_1253_1253" id="FNanchor_1253_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a></p>

<p>Here we shall only hint at Melanchthon’s attitude&mdash;again
characterised by weakness and indecision&mdash;at the time
of the Interim controversy. He himself, from motives of
policy and out of consideration for the interests of the Court,
had lent a hand in the bringing about of the Leipzig Interim.
The “real” Lutherans (“<i>Gnesio-Lutherans</i>”) saw in this
an alliance with the Popish abomination. The “temporising
policy of the Interim” in which he “became entangled,”
remarks Carl Sell, “called forth the righteous anger of all
honest German Protestants.” “Melanchthon saved his
life’s work only at the cost of the agony of the last thirteen
years of his life ... a real martyr&mdash;albeit a tragically
guilty one&mdash;to a cause.”<a name="FNanchor_1254_1254" id="FNanchor_1254_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a> “The whole struggle of ‘Gnesio-Lutheranism’
with ‘Philippism’ consisted in employing
against Melanchthon the very weapon of which Melanchthon
himself had made use,” viz. the “confusion of theological
opinions with the Divine data which these opinions purported
to represent.”<a name="FNanchor_1255_1255" id="FNanchor_1255_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a></p>

<p class="p2">A redeeming feature in the life of this unhappy man,
upon which one is glad to dwell after what has gone before,
was his strong sense of right and wrong. In spite of all his
weakness, his conscience was highly sensitive. Thus he
himself supplies in many cases the moral appreciation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
his actions in his outspoken statements and frank confessions
to some trusted friend, for whom his words were
also intended to serve as a guide.</p>

<p>To his friends he was in the habit of giving advice on
their behaviour, couching such advice in the language of the
scholar. Nor was he jesting when he declared that such
good counsel was intended in the first instance for himself;
in practice, however, the deed fell short of the will. So
excellent was his theory that many of his aphorisms, in their
short, classical form, became permanent principles of
morality. Their influence was on a par with that of his
pedagogical writings, which long held sway in the history
of education.</p>

<p>His friends could count not only on the ethical guidance
of the philosopher and Humanist, but even on his ready
assistance in matters of all sorts. It was not in his nature
to refuse his sympathy to anyone, and, to the students, who
gladly sought his assistance, he was unable to say no.</p>

<p>Another valuable quality was that talent for making
peace, of which he repeatedly made use in the interests of
his co-religionists. His conversation and bearing were
exceedingly courteous. Erasmus, for instance, speaks of his
“irresistible charm” (“<i>gratia quædam fatalis</i>”). In a letter
of 1531 Erasmus says: “In addition to his excellent
education and rare eloquence, he possesses an irresistible
charm, due more to ‘<i>genius</i>’ than to ‘<i>ingenium</i>.’ For
this reason he stands in high esteem with noble minds, and,
even amongst his enemies, there is not one who cordially
hates him.”<a name="FNanchor_1256_1256" id="FNanchor_1256_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a> At the time of the Interim controversy the
agents of the Duke of Saxony were desirous that the
Catholic party should find men of real moderation and
culture to negotiate with Melanchthon and the other leaders
of the new faith. They were particularly anxious that
Claudius Jaius, the Jesuit, should repair to Saxony for this
purpose. Peter Canisius, apprised of this, wrote, on April 30,
1551, to Ignatius his superior, that these people were sure
from experience that Jaius, with the modesty he owed to his
culture, would do more good than the most violent controversies.<a name="FNanchor_1257_1257" id="FNanchor_1257_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the world Melanchthon was careful to hide the
growing dissension between himself and Luther.</p>

<p>Thus, writing on June 22, 1537, to Veit Dietrich, he
says, alluding to the quarrel commenced by Cordatus, that
he was working for peace at Wittenberg University. “Nor
does Luther appear to be badly disposed towards us”;
“no hatred exists, and should there be any it will presently
break out”; for his own part he intends to be patient,
“even should it come to blows [’<i>plaga</i>’].”<a name="FNanchor_1258_1258" id="FNanchor_1258_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a></p>

<p>Even Luther’s outbursts of anger were explained away
by his more supple comrade, who exhorts his friends to
possess their souls in patience and to conceal such faults
from the eyes of the world. The “dreadful man,” he writes
to Bucer&mdash;applying to Luther the Homeric title [Greek: deinos]&mdash;“often
gets these boisterous fits. More is gained by ignoring
them than by open contradiction. Let us therefore make
use of the philosophy in which we both have been initiated,
cover our wounds, and exhort others too to do the same.”
Luther, owing to his combativeness, was not to be depended
on, and the sad part of it is that “our little Churches are
tossed about with neither sail nor sober pilot”; for his part
he feared victory as much as war; he was opposed to war
in the cause of the Evangel because in the confusion the
Court officials and the great ones of the Protestant party,
the “Centaurs,” would assuredly stretch out greedy hands
to grasp the rights and possessions of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_1259_1259" id="FNanchor_1259_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1259_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a></p>

<p>Melanchthon was at that time in a certain sense the
“one who, thanks to his moderation, kept everything
together at Wittenberg. This is expressly stated by
Cruciger.”<a name="FNanchor_1260_1260" id="FNanchor_1260_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a> For this his endless patience, what he himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
terms his “servile spirit,”<a name="FNanchor_1261_1261" id="FNanchor_1261_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1261_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a> was to some extent accountable.
Yet his Humanism, and the equanimity, calmness and moderation
he owed to it, doubtless served the peacemaker in
good stead. To all, whether of his own party or of the
opposite, he was wont to declare his abhorrence of the
“<i>democratia aut tyrannis indoctorum</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_1262_1262" id="FNanchor_1262_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a> Owing to such
personal qualities of Melanchthon’s, Cochlæus himself, in a
letter to his friend Dantiscus, in which he attacks Melanchthon,
admits that he was “nevertheless at heart very fond
of him.”<a name="FNanchor_1263_1263" id="FNanchor_1263_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a></p>

<p class="pc2 mid">LUTHER’S RELATIONS WITH ZWINGLI, CARLSTADT, BUGENHAGEN
AND OTHERS</p>

<h3>1. Zwingli and the Controversy on the Supper</h3>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">From</span> the time that Zwingli, in 1519, commenced working
on his own lines at Zürich in the cause of the religious
innovations, he had borrowed more and more largely from
Luther’s writings. Whilst acknowledging Luther’s great
achievements he did not, however, sacrifice his independence.
Writing in 1523 with a strong sense of what he himself had
done and of the success which had attended his own efforts,
he said: “I began to preach before ever I had heard of
Luther.... I was not instructed by Luther, for, until two
years ago, his very name was unknown to me, and I worked
on the Bible Word alone.... Nor do I intend to be
called after Luther, seeing that I have read but little of his
doctrine. What I have read of his writings, however, is
as a rule so excellently grounded on the Word of God, that
no creature can overthrow it.... I did not learn the
teaching of Christ from Luther, but from the Word of God.
If Luther preaches Christ, he is doing the same as I, though,
praise be to God, countless more souls have been led to God
by him than by me.”<a name="FNanchor_1264_1264" id="FNanchor_1264_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a></p>

<p>Little attention was paid at Wittenberg to the religious
occurrences at Zürich, though they had been welcomed by
Luther. Only when Zwingli sided with Carlstadt against
Luther in the controversy on the Supper did the latter
begin to give him more heed; this he at once did in his
own fashion. He asserted, as he had already done in the
case of Carlstadt, [Œcolampadius and others, that Zwingli
would not have known the truth concerning Christ and the
Evangel “had not Luther first written on the subject”; of
his own initiative he would never have dared to come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
freedom and the light; later he spoke of him as “a child
of his loins” who had betrayed him.<a name="FNanchor_1265_1265" id="FNanchor_1265_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a></p>

<p>In 1526 the divergency of opinion between Luther and
Zwingli on the subject of the Real Presence of Christ in the
Blessed Sacrament, already present as early as 1524,
became much more apparent.<a name="FNanchor_1266_1266" id="FNanchor_1266_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a></p>

<p>Luther, in 1526, in his “Sermon von dem Sacrament,”
and, in 1527, in his work on the words “This is My Body,”
had, conformably with his theory, urged that Christ is
present with the bread, and spoken not at all kindly of his
Swiss gainsayers, the Zwinglians.<a name="FNanchor_1267_1267" id="FNanchor_1267_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1267_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a> Zwingli, on his side,
soon after the appearance of the last work, attacked Luther’s
view in a writing entitled “<i>Amica exegesis</i>” (1528); this,
his first open assault on the Wittenberg doctor, he followed
up with a German pamphlet on the words of Christ: “This
is My Body.” In these we have the protest of the sceptical
rationalism of Zürich, against Luther’s half-hearted doctrine
on the Sacrament.</p>

<p>Zwingli demanded that the words of institution should be
taken figuratively and the Eucharist regarded as a mere
symbol of the Body of Christ. This he did with no less
assurance than Luther had urged his own pet view, viz.
that Christ is present together with the bread (Impanation
instead of the Catholic doctrine of Transubstantiation).
Zwingli complained bitterly of the rude tone adopted by
Luther; according to him God’s Word must prevail, not
Luther’s abusive epithets, “fanatic, devil, rogue, heretic,
Trotz, Plotz, Blitz and Donner, and so on.” Over and over
again he roundly accuses Luther of “lying” and “falsehood,”
though his language is not so lurid as his adversary’s.
The artifices by which he sought to evade the plain sense
of the words “This is My Body,” were well calculated to
call forth a rude contradiction from Luther. Zwingli’s
arbitrary recourse to the “figurative, symbolical, metaphorical”
sense, Luther answered by appealing to the interpretation
accepted by the whole of antiquity. At the turn
of the fourth and the fifth centuries Macarius Magnes had
written: “Christ has said ‘This is My Body’; it is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
figure of the Body of Christ, nor a figure of His flesh, as some
have been foolish enough to assert, but in truth the body
and blood of Christ.”<a name="FNanchor_1268_1268" id="FNanchor_1268_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1268_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a> Concerning the promise of the
Eucharist, Hilary of Poitiers declared in the fourth century:
“Christ says: ‘My flesh is meat indeed’ (John vi. 56);
as to the truth of the flesh and blood there can be no doubt.
The Lord Himself teaches it and our faith confesses it, viz.
that it is truly flesh and truly blood.” Any other interpretation
of the words of Christ he calls “<i>violenta atque
imprudens prædicatio, aliena atque impia intelligentia</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_1269_1269" id="FNanchor_1269_1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1269_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a>
The reproach, which at a much earlier period Ignatius of
Antioch, a disciple of the Apostles, had brought forward
against the Docetæ of his day, Luther might well have
applied to the Zwinglians: “They refuse to confess that
the Eucharist is the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, that
flesh which suffered for our sins and which the Father raised
from the dead.”<a name="FNanchor_1270_1270" id="FNanchor_1270_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1270_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a></p>

<p>We can understand the abhorrence which Luther conveyed
by the term Sacramentarians (“<i>sacramentarii</i>”), by
which he characterised all those&mdash;whether Swiss, Reformed,
or followers of Carlstadt&mdash;who denied the Real Presence in
the Sacrament.</p>

<p>The Marburg Conference of 1529, at which both Zwingli
and Luther attended with their friends, did not bring any
real settlement, for no compromise on the question of the
Eucharist was feasible. Fourteen of the other Articles
submitted by Luther were accepted, but the 15th, with this
principal question, remained in suspense owing to the
opposition of the Swiss. In consequence of this Luther
refused to recognise Zwingli and his followers as brothers,
in spite of all the prayers of his opponents. He would not
concede to them Christian brotherhood but merely “Christian
charity,” that charity, moreover, which, as he declared,
we owe even to our enemies. He again voiced it as his
opinion, that, “your spirit is different from ours,” which
greatly incensed the other side. A statement was appended
to the Fifteen Articles of Marburg, to the effect, that, on
account of the Supper, they had “so far failed to reach an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
understanding, but that each side would exercise Christian
charity towards the other so far as every man’s conscience
allowed.”</p>

<p>Once, during the proceedings, Luther, to show his attachment
to the literal sense of the words “This is My Body,”
chalked these words on the tablecloth and held it up in front
of him, pointing significantly to the writing.</p>

<p>Luther, however, overlooked the fact, that, if once the
words were taken in their literal sense, as he was perfectly
right in doing, there was no alternative but to accept the
Catholic interpretation, according to which the bread is
actually and substantially changed into the Body of Christ,
and that to say: “This is bread though Christ is present,”
was really out of the question. Many theologians who
follow Luther in other matters, unhesitatingly admit his inconsequence.<a name="FNanchor_1271_1271" id="FNanchor_1271_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1271_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a></p>

<p>At the solemn meeting at Marburg, Luther was not to be
disconcerted, not even when Zwingli argued that the words
of promise of the Sacrament in St. John’s Gospel (vi. 32 ff.,
48 ff.), where we read: “My flesh is meat indeed,” must
mean “my flesh signifies meat.” When Luther, no less
erroneously, objected that the passage in question did not
apply there, Zwingli exclaimed: “Of course not, Doctor,
for that passage is the breaking of your neck.” Luther
replied testily: “Don’t be so sure of it; necks don’t break
so easily; here you are in Hesse, not in Switzerland!”
Zwingli was constrained to protest that, even in Switzerland,
people enjoyed the protection of the law, and to explain that
what he had said had not been meant by way of any threat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>Behind the efforts to unite Wittenberg and Zürich there
was a different influence at work. Philip, Landgrave of
Hesse, like Zwingli, was anxious to establish a league of
all the Swiss and German Protestants against those who, in
the Empire, defended Catholicism. This proposal Luther
resisted with all his might, urging the Landgrave not to
make common cause with the false teachers, to the delight
of the devil. Melanchthon, who also was present, was
likewise pleased to see the Landgrave’s plan frustrated, for
it would have rendered impossible any reconciliation with
the Emperor and the larger portion of the Empire, which
was the vague ideal after which he was striving. The parties,
however, were too distrustful of each other to arrive at any
settlement. Jonas, for his diplomacy, called Bucer a “fox,”
and said of Zwingli, that he detected in him a certain
arrogance such as was to be expected in a boor.</p>

<p>At the time of the Marburg Conference, Vienna was being
besieged by the Turks. Thus, whilst the Empire stood in
the greatest peril from foes without, an attempt was being
made within to reach a settlement which might drive the
wedge yet deeper into the unity of the Fatherland. The latter
attempt ended, however, in failure, whilst the siege of
Vienna was raised and the departure of the Turks brought
about a certain strengthening of the Empire.</p>

<p>The tension between the Zwinglians and the Lutherans
was not lessened when each party claimed that it had
gained the upper hand and utterly routed the other at
Marburg.</p>

<p>On October 11, 1531, Zwingli fell in the battle of Cappel,
in which, mounted on horseback and fully armed, he was
leading the men of Zürich against the five Catholic cantons.
What Luther thought and felt at that time we learn both
from Schlaginhaufen’s Notes of his Table-Talk in 1531 and
1532, which afford some fresh information, and from
Luther’s letters and printed works.</p>

<p>The very first Note we have of Schlaginhaufen’s touches
upon Zwingli’s untimely end. It would appear that a
rumour had got abroad that Luther’s other opponents,
Carlstadt and Pellicanus, had also been slain.</p>

<p>Luther was in high glee when news of Zwingli’s death
reached him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">He said: “God knows the thoughts of the heart. It is well that
Zwingli, Carlstadt, and Pellicanus lie dead on the battle-field, for
otherwise we could not have retained the Landgrave, Strasburg
and other of our neighbours [true to our doctrine]. Oh, what a
triumph is this, that they have perished! God indeed knows
His business well.”<a name="FNanchor_1272_1272" id="FNanchor_1272_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a>&mdash;“Zwingli died like a brigand,” he said
later, when scarcely a year had elapsed since his death. “He
wished to force others to accept his errors, went to war, and was
slain.” “He drew the sword, therefore he has received his
reward, for Christ says: ‘All who take the sword shall perish by
the sword.’ If God has saved him, then He did so contrary
to His ordinary ways.”<a name="FNanchor_1273_1273" id="FNanchor_1273_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a>&mdash;“All seek to cloak their deceitful
doctrines with the name of the Evangel,” so he exclaims in 1532.
From Augsburg he heard that the Sacramentarian (i.e. Zwinglian)
preachers were using his name and Melanchthon’s. “Since they
refused to be our friends in God’s name, let them be so in the
devil’s, even as Judas was the friend of Christ.”<a name="FNanchor_1274_1274" id="FNanchor_1274_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a></p>

<p>Because Thomas Münzer was no friend of the Evangel he was,
according to Luther, destined to perish miserably and shamefully.
Zwingli he placed on exactly the same footing; his death
likewise was a just judgment.<a name="FNanchor_1275_1275" id="FNanchor_1275_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a> Zwingli, so he will have it, was a
complete unbeliever. In his newly published sermons of 1530 he
had shown that Zwingli, like Carlstadt, by his attacks on the
Supper, had denied all the articles of the faith. “If a man falls
away from one article of faith, however insignificant it may
appear to reason, he has fallen away from all and does not hold
any of them aright. For instance, it is certain that our fanatics
who now deny the Sacrament, also deny Christ’s Divinity and
all the other articles of faith, however much they protest to the
contrary, and the reason of this is, that, when even one link of
the chain is broken, the whole chain is in pieces.”<a name="FNanchor_1276_1276" id="FNanchor_1276_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1276_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a></p>

<p>H. Barge, a Protestant, remarks: “After the battle of Cappel,
Luther appears to have devoted his unusual gifts of eloquence to
slandering Zwingli and all who remained true to him, systematically,
deliberately, and maliciously, as mere heretics.”<a name="FNanchor_1277_1277" id="FNanchor_1277_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a></p>

<p>The following delineation of Zwingli by Luther dates from
1538: “Zwingli was a very clever and upright man, but he fell
[into error]; then he became so presumptuous as to dare to say
and write: ‘I hold that no one in the world ever believed that
the Body and Blood of Christ are present in the Sacrament.’”
Luther adds: Because Zwingli ventured to speak rashly against
him [Luther] and “against what is plain to the whole world, he
perished miserably, just as did Egranus, that importunate
fellow.”<a name="FNanchor_1278_1278" id="FNanchor_1278_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a></p>

<p>Just as he had condemned Carlstadt and Pellicanus, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
lastly, Egranus (Johann Silvius Egranus of Zwickau), so also
elsewhere he lumps together in one condemnation with Zwingli
all those doctors who differed from him. Relentlessly he scourges
them as he had scourged the Catholics. “The character of those
who oppose the Word is fiendish rather than human. Man does
what he can, but when the devil takes possession of him then
‘enmity arises between him and the woman’” (Gen. iii. 15).<a name="FNanchor_1279_1279" id="FNanchor_1279_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a></p>

<p>Few experienced his intolerance to such an extent as Andreas
Bodenstein von Carlstadt, his quondam colleague in the theological
faculty of Wittenberg.</p></div>

<h3>2. Carlstadt</h3>

<p>Carlstadt, the fanatic, failed to obtain any peace from
Luther until he passed over to the camp of the Swiss
theologians. In 1534 he became preacher at St. Peter’s in
Basle, and professor of theology. We may here cast a
glance at the troubles brought on him, partly through
Luther, partly through his own passionate exaltation, both
previous to this date and until his death at Basle, where he
was carried off by the plague in 1541.</p>

<p>Carlstadt’s violent doings at Wittenberg and the iconoclasm
which he justified by the Mosaic prohibition of
graven images, had miscarried owing to Luther’s warnings.<a name="FNanchor_1280_1280" id="FNanchor_1280_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a>
Soon it became clear that there was no longer any room for
him at the University town near the leader of the Reformation,
more particularly since, in 1522, he had seen fit to
deny the presence of Christ in the Sacrament. Luther
loudly bewailed Carlstadt’s sudden determination to become
a new teacher, and to lay new injunctions on the people to
the detriment of his (Luther’s) authority.<a name="FNanchor_1281_1281" id="FNanchor_1281_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a></p>

<p>Carlstadt now migrated to Orlamünde in the Saxon
Electorate, where the magistrates appointed him pastor.
In August, 1524, however, Luther passed through Weimar,
Jena, and the other districts where the fanatics had gained
a footing, preaching energetically against them. Carlstadt
he had met at Jena on August 22, 1523, in the Black Bear
Inn. In vain did they seek a friendly settlement, for each
overwhelmed the other with reproaches. Finally, in the
tap-room of the inn, Luther handed his opponent a goldgulden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
as a pledge that he was at liberty to write against
him without reserve and that he did not mind in the least:
“Take it and attack me like a man, don’t fear!”<a name="FNanchor_1282_1282" id="FNanchor_1282_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a> Shortly
after, however, he complained of the treatment he had
received: “At the inn at Jena ... he turned upon me
and abused me, snapped his fingers at me and said: ‘I
don’t care that for you.’ But if he does not respect me,
whom, then, amongst us does he respect?”<a name="FNanchor_1283_1283" id="FNanchor_1283_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a></p>

<p>The struggle continued after they had gone their ways,
both seeking to secure the favour of the Court. Luther,
through the agency of Prince Johann Frederick, proposed
that Carlstadt should be hounded from his place of refuge
and from the whole upper valley of the Saale. Ultimately
the disturber of the peace was banished from the Electorate;
Luther, in his work “Widder die hymelischen Propheten,”
approved of his expulsion, roughly declaring that, so far as
lay in him, Carlstadt would never again set foot in the
country.<a name="FNanchor_1284_1284" id="FNanchor_1284_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a> The homeless man now betook himself to Strasburg,
whither he was pursued by a furious letter of Luther’s,
directed against him and his teaching, entitled “An die
Christen zu Straspurg widder den Schwermer Geyst.”</p>

<p>Luther became greatly enraged when he perceived that
the denial of the Sacrament, already widespread in Switzerland,
was also gaining ground at Strasburg and was being
adopted by Capito and Bucer. In his excitement, in the
hope of checking the falling away from his doctrine, of
closing the mouth of that “fiend” Carlstadt&mdash;who likewise
stood for the denial of the Sacrament&mdash;and of preventing
“the overthrow of all political and ecclesiastical order,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
penned, in the course of a few weeks, a violent screed
entitled, “Widder die hymelischen Propheten.” The
knowledge that everywhere revolt “was being associated
with the Lutheran doctrines and reforms”<a name="FNanchor_1285_1285" id="FNanchor_1285_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a> roused his
terrible eloquence, of which the principal aim was to
annihilate Carlstadt. Having completed the first part,
comprising seventy pages of print in the Erlangen edition,
he rushed this through the press as a preliminary instalment,
informing his readers at the end that “the remainder will
follow on foot.”<a name="FNanchor_1286_1286" id="FNanchor_1286_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a> As good as his word, three weeks later,
he had ready the conclusion, consisting of nearly one hundred
pages of print. He asserts that Carlstadt had, “for three
years, been making a hash” of his books; he was even
anxious to throw them all overboard. Luther’s strongest
argument against him was the revolutionary peril which
this man represented. Even if he did not actually plot
“murder and revolt,” he writes, “yet I must say that he
has a murderous and revolutionary spirit.... Because he
carries a dagger, I do not trust him; he might well be
simply awaiting a good opportunity to do what I apprehend.
By the dagger I mean his false interpretation and understanding
of the Law of Moses.”<a name="FNanchor_1287_1287" id="FNanchor_1287_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a> “What is the use of
admonishing him?” he writes, alluding to Carlstadt’s
departure from the Lutheran interpretation of the Bible
and his obstinacy in accepting no exegesis but his own; “I
believe that he still considers me one of the most learned
men at Wittenberg and yet he tells me to my very face, that
I am of no account, though all the while he pretends to be
quite willing to be instructed.”<a name="FNanchor_1288_1288" id="FNanchor_1288_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a></p>

<p>From Strasburg, Carlstadt, the restless wanderer, had gone to
Rothenburg-on-the-Tauber, a hotbed of Anabaptists. It was whilst
here, that finding himself in dire want, he besought Luther’s aid,
at a time when the latter had not yet finished the above writing
against him; he, however, frustrated all hopes of any reconciliation
by previously penning a defence of his own doctrine of the Sacrament
against the Wittenberg professor. The unfortunate termination of the
Peasant War exposed him to grave danger, when he broke his promise to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
keep silence, and again renewed his complaints concerning Luther, and
bewailed his own reduced circumstances, dissensions broke out afresh
between them. Luther, who was greatly vexed, was very anxious to find
some new means of muzzling his opponent. He proposed that he should in
no case advocate in the presence of others his own theological opinions
or his private interpretation of the Bible, though he might cherish
them as his private convictions, for of the heart no man is judge;
doctrines which differed from his own, so Luther declared, were not to
be defended publicly, else they would come under the cognisance of the
authorities. Under these circumstances Carlstadt thought it better to
depart. In the beginning of 1529 he escaped, and, in 1530, found a home
in Switzerland, where he enjoyed a quieter life and was free to proceed
with his theological labours. “Luther, like Carlstadt, never doubted
for a moment that his doctrine was really founded on Scripture. Hence
Luther and the Elector felt themselves bound in conscience to defend
as best they could the Christian faith and their country against any
invasion of false doctrine.”<a name="FNanchor_1289_1289" id="FNanchor_1289_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a> Such is the considered judgment of a
Protestant historian.<a name="FNanchor_1290_1290" id="FNanchor_1290_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a></p>

<p class="p2">For the period subsequent to 1534, when Carlstadt at
length began to lead a more tranquil life as professor and
preacher at Basle, the Table-Talk is the principal source of
information concerning Luther’s relations with him.</p>

<p>Luther, in his conversations, frequently referred to his
former friend, particularly in 1538.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“He, like Bucer, greatly retarded the progress of the Evangel
by his arrogance. In other matters pride of intellect is not so
dangerous, but in theology it is utterly pestilential to desire to
arrogate anything to oneself.... Hence I was greatly troubled
when Carlstadt once remarked to me: ‘I am as fond of honour
as any other man.’ At Leipzig he refused to concede me the first
place at the Disputation lest I should rob him of his part of the
praise. And yet I was always glad to do him a favour. But he
reaped shame instead of honour at Leipzig, for no worse disputant
could be imagined than a man of so dull and wretched a spirit....
At first he, like Peter Lupinus, withstood me, but when I
rebutted them with Augustine, they, too, studied Augustine and
then insisted upon my doctrine more than I did myself. Carlstadt,
however, was deceived by his arrogance.”<a name="FNanchor_1291_1291" id="FNanchor_1291_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a> Indeed, Carlstadt
belonged to the category of the “<i>arrogantissimi</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_1292_1292" id="FNanchor_1292_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a></p>

<p>Elsewhere Luther again says similar things without noticing, so
it would seem, that others might have complained of his “arrogance”
just as much as he did of Carlstadt’s. Carlstadt is “full
of presumption,” and this “brought about his fall as it did that
of Münzer, Zwingli, [Œcolampadius, Stiefel, and Eisleben.”
“Such people, weak and untried though they be, are puffed
up with self-sufficiency before the victory, whereas I have
my daily struggles.” Before this Luther had declared that he
was “plagued and vexed by the devil, whose bones are strong
until we crack them.”<a name="FNanchor_1293_1293" id="FNanchor_1293_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a>&mdash;“It was impossible to make of Carlstadt
a humble man because he had been through no real mental
temptations.”<a name="FNanchor_1294_1294" id="FNanchor_1294_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a>&mdash;“He, like Münzer and Zwingli, was rash when
good fortune attended him, but an arrant coward in misfortune”;<a name="FNanchor_1295_1295" id="FNanchor_1295_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a>
Luther here was probably recalling how Carlstadt, the unhappy
married priest, had been forced to humble himself before him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
owing to the dire want and danger in which he and his family
found themselves.</p>

<p>“Had not Carlstadt come on the scene with the fanatics,
Münzer and the Anabaptists, all would have gone well with my
undertaking. But though I alone lifted it out of the gutter, they
wished to seize upon the prize and poach upon my preserves,
though, owing to the way they went about the business, they
were really working for the Pope though all the while anxious
to destroy him.”<a name="FNanchor_1296_1296" id="FNanchor_1296_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Luther afterwards held fast to the opinion concerning his
enemy which he had expressed long before in a letter to
Spalatin: “Carlstadt has now been delivered over to a
reprobate spirit so that I despair of his return. He always
was, and probably always will be, unmindful of the glory of
Christ; his insensate ambition has brought him to this. To
me, nay, to us, he is more troublesome than any foe, so that
I believe the unhappy man to be possessed by more than one
devil. God have mercy on his sin, so far as it is mortal.”<a name="FNanchor_1297_1297" id="FNanchor_1297_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a></p>

<p>In 1541 the news of his rival’s death reached him. It
was rumoured that he had died impenitent, that the devil
had appeared at his death-bed, had fetched him away, and
continued to make a great noise in his house.<a name="FNanchor_1298_1298" id="FNanchor_1298_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a> Luther
believed these tales. It was not surprising, so he said, that
Carlstadt had at last received his deserts,<a name="FNanchor_1299_1299" id="FNanchor_1299_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a> though he was
sorry he should have died impenitent.<a name="FNanchor_1300_1300" id="FNanchor_1300_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a></p>

<p class="p2">It only remains to glance at the arguments Luther brought
forward and at the theoretical attitude he assumed with
regard to Carlstadt and his followers. If we take the book
“Widder die hymelischen Propheten” and the writing he
addressed to the Strasburg Christians against the fanatics,
and consider the answers and objections they drew forth,
we shall have a strange picture of Luther’s ways of reasoning
and of his crooked lines of thought. Not that his
ability and eloquence failed him, but, for clearness and
coherence, his doctrine and whole conduct leave everything
to be desired. In his book he attacks not Carlstadt alone,
but, as he says: “Carlstadt and his spirits,” i.e. all those
opponents of his whom he was pleased to dub “fanatics.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>”
“Fanaticism” to him means not merely that fanciful
interpretation of the Bible based on special illumination,
to which his opponents were attached, but more particularly
the threefold error for which they stood, viz. their denial of
the Sacrament (i.e. of the Real Presence of Christ in the
Supper), their iconoclasm, and, thirdly, their repudiation of
infant baptism. As for the various elements of good, which,
in spite of all their mistakes, were shared by the earlier
Anabaptists, Luther refused categorically to see them or
to hearken to the fanatics’ well-grounded remonstrances
against certain of his propositions.</p>

<p>To preach, a man must be called by God, so he lays it
down. Had your spirit “been the true one, it would have
manifested itself by word and sign; but in reality it is a
murderous, secret devil.”<a name="FNanchor_1301_1301" id="FNanchor_1301_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a> Luther demands miracles with
as much confidence as though he himself could point to
them in plenty.</p>

<p>Those preachers who ventured to differ from him, he
invites, at the very least, to point to their ecclesiastical
vocation. But what sort of a vocation was this to be, they
asked. As Luther recognised no universal Church visible,
a call emanating from a congregation of believers had to
suffice; Carlstadt, for instance, could appeal to his having
been chosen by Orlamünde as its pastor. This Luther would
not allow: You must also have the consent of the Elector
and of the University of Wittenberg. Carlstadt and those
who felt with him were well aware, that, in the final instance,
this simply meant Luther’s own consent, for at the University
he was all-powerful, whilst the sovereign likewise was
wont to be guided by him. Why, Carlstadt might also have
asked, should not the degree of Doctor of Divinity suffice
in my case, seeing that you yourself have solemnly pleaded
your degree as a sufficient justification for assailing the
common tradition of Christendom?</p>

<p>Luther’s final answer to such an appeal was as follows:</p>

<p>“My devil, I know you well.”<a name="FNanchor_1302_1302" id="FNanchor_1302_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a></p>

<p>He was determined to hound out of his last hiding-place
his presumptuous rival, many of whose doctrines, it must
be admitted, were both mistaken and dangerous. Hence
the measure which he induced the Elector to take in 1524,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
according to which Carlstadt was to be refused shelter
throughout the Electorate; this example was also followed
by the magistrates of Rothenburg-on-the-Tauber, who, by
an edict of January 27, 1525, commanded all burghers by
virtue of their oath and fealty “not to house, shelter, or
hide, provide with food and drink, or further on his way the
said Dr. Carlstadt,” adding, that a similar prohibition had
been published in “other lordships and Imperial cities
both near and far.”<a name="FNanchor_1303_1303" id="FNanchor_1303_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a></p>

<p>When seeking to retain the support of the burghers of
Strasburg, Luther had made a display of broadminded forbearance
and charity. What he then said is often quoted
by his followers as proof of his kindliness and humility.
“Take heed that you show brotherly charity towards one
another in very deed.” “I am not your preacher. No one
is bound to believe me, let each one look to himself. To warn
all I am able, but stop any man I cannot.” Yet he continues:
“Carlstadt makes a great fuss about outward things
as though Christianity consisted in knocking down images,
overthrowing the Sacrament, and preventing Baptism;
by the dust he raises he seeks to darken the sun, and the
brightness of the Evangel, and the main facts of Christian
faith and practice, so that the world may forget all that has
hitherto been taught by us.”<a name="FNanchor_1304_1304" id="FNanchor_1304_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a> Luther’s own doctrine,
in spite of his preliminary assurance, was alone to stand,
because, forsooth, it reveals the true sun to the world.</p>

<p>What, however, had he to oppose to the “knocking
down of images” and the “overthrow of the Sacrament”?
Did his standpoint afford sufficient resistance, or was it
more than a mere subterfuge?</p>

<p>The pulling down of images and the overthrow of the
Sacrament, Luther tells Carlstadt, agreeably with his own
feelings at that time, may be introduced little by little, but
must not be made into a law. Everyone is free to put away
his images, to deny the Sacrament, or to refuse to receive it;
let him follow his own conscience as it is the right and duty
of every man to do. Luther, however, is forgetful of the
restrictions he was in the habit of placing upon Catholic
practices, of how he refused to admit the rights of conscience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
in the matter of the Mass and the religious life, notwithstanding
that Catholics could appeal to the age-long practice
of the Church in every land, and of his denial of the existence
or even of the possibility of good faith amongst any of his
opponents, whether within or without his own fold. In
his book against the “Heavenly Prophets” he declares it
to be “optional to wear a cowl or the tonsure ... in this
there is neither commandment nor prohibition,” “to wear
the tonsure, to put on albs and chasubles, etc. is a thing
God has neither commanded nor forbidden.” “Doctrine,
command, and compulsion are not to be tolerated.”<a name="FNanchor_1305_1305" id="FNanchor_1305_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a> Here
we see the confused after-effects of his old, pseudo-mystic
conception of a religion of freedom, involving no duty of
submission to any external authority in the matter of
“doctrine or command.” (See p. 8 ff.)</p>

<p>Granting that any real tolerance underlay these statements,
the fanatics could ask: “Why, then, not include our
peculiarities, for instance, our penitential dress, our grey
frock, and outward, pious practices?” Luther, however, will
hear of no self-chosen works of penance, and condemns
indiscriminately those of the fanatics and the more measured
ones preferred by Catholics, in spite of mortification being
recommended by the example of the saints both of the
Old and the New Covenant and of Christ Himself. Of
the last Luther says quite openly that Christ’s example
taught us nothing; not Christ’s works, but merely His
express words were to be our example. “What He wished
us to do or leave undone, that He not only did or left undone
but also enjoined or forbade in so many words.... Hence
we admit no example, not even that of Christ Himself.”<a name="FNanchor_1306_1306" id="FNanchor_1306_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a>
Elsewhere he also excludes the Evangelical Counsels of
Perfection, although they are not only based on example,
but are also expressed in words. Yet here, in a particular
instance, he departs from his theory that only Christ’s
express injunctions are binding; Carlstadt had done away
with the elevation of the Sacrament in Divine Worship;
this Luther disapproved of; he acknowledges, however,
that Christ did not do so at the Last Supper, though <i>we</i> do.&mdash;He
does not tell us when or how Christ enjoined this by
“word.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>What the motives were which led to his decisions on such
usages we see from the following. Speaking to Carlstadt’s
party he says: “Although I too had the intention of doing
away with the Elevation, yet, now, the better to defy and
oppose for a while the fanatical spirit, I shall not do so.”<a name="FNanchor_1307_1307" id="FNanchor_1307_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a>
In the same way, “in defiance of the spirit of the mob, he
intends to call the Sacrament a Sacrifice, though it is not
really one, but simply the reception of what was once a
sacrifice.” We cannot wonder if the sectarians looked upon
this spirit of defiance and contradiction as something
strange. One of them during this controversy complained
with some justice that Luther, according to his own admission,
had thundered forth many of his theses merely because
the Papists “had pressed him so hard,” and not from any
inner conviction.<a name="FNanchor_1308_1308" id="FNanchor_1308_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a> Contradiction was to him sufficient reason
for narrowing the freedom of others in the matter of doctrine.</p>

<p>The new Christian freedom Luther vindicates in his
book “Widder die hymelischen Propheten,” more particularly
in respect of the Old Testament Commandments.
At that time, strange to say, the fanatics were set on
imposing certain of the Mosaic laws on both public and
ecclesiastical life, under the impression that they were
precepts divinely ordained for all time. For this Luther’s
own violent and one-sided interpretation of the Bible, in
defiance of all tradition, was really responsible; indeed, he
himself was not disinclined to lay undue stress on Mosaism.
(See vol. v., xxix., xxxv. 6.)</p>

<p>The fanatics’ exaggerations were, however, too much
for Luther. In his efforts to oppose their trend he goes so
far as to include even the Decalogue, when he exclaims:
“Don’t bother us with Moses”; the Ten Commandments
are disfigured with Mosaism, so he says, for they prescribe
the Sabbath and forbid images; it was stupid to see in the
Decalogue nothing more than moral commandments and
precepts of the natural law.<a name="FNanchor_1309_1309" id="FNanchor_1309_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a> Not on account of this law
do we observe the weekly day of rest, but because we need
a rest and regular times for Divine worship, viz. out of love
for our neighbour and from necessity. It is no easy matter
to reconcile this with Luther’s own praiseworthy practice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
teaching the Commandments and seeing that the young
were instructed in them, or with the great respect with
which he surrounded the Decalogue. The Church’s view, as
expounded by St. Thomas, was both better and more
logical, viz. that the Ten Commandments were the primary
and common precepts of the law of nature,<a name="FNanchor_1310_1310" id="FNanchor_1310_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a> and that the
alteration in the third Commandment, introduced by the
Church concerning the day (Sunday in place of the Sabbath),
was merely a minor detail not affecting the real substance of
the Commandment.</p>

<p>That, however, the Sunday, instead of the Saturday, was
to be observed as holy was a point on which Luther had
perforce to content himself with that very tradition which
he had so often abused.</p>

<p>Tradition likewise was his only authority for defending
Infant Baptism with so much determination against the
fanatics. It is true, that, in order to deprive his opponents
of their chief argument, he put forth the strange theory,
treated of elsewhere, that infants are able to believe.<a name="FNanchor_1311_1311" id="FNanchor_1311_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a>
Elsewhere, too, he seeks to persuade himself, in spite of all
difficulties, that infants in some way or other co-operate in
the baptismal work of justification by means of some sort
of faith.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he confutes Carlstadt’s opinion as to
the figurative sense of the Eucharistic words of consecration
in a masterly dissertation on their real meaning. Here he
holds the field because his interpretation is conformable
both with that of antiquity and with the dictates of reason.
We find him demolishing Carlstadt’s stupidities by appeals
to reason, but here Luther is in contradiction with himself,
for in another part of the book, where, for his purpose, it
was essential to make out reason to be absolutely blind as
regards doctrine, he has the strongest invectives against it
or any use of reason in matters of faith. In the case of
Carlstadt’s objections against the Sacramental Presence of
Christ, he had been obliged to have recourse to proofs based
on reason, yet in the other passage he says: “As if we did
not know that reason is the devil’s handmaid and does
nothing but blaspheme and dishonour all that God says or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
does.”<a name="FNanchor_1312_1312" id="FNanchor_1312_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a> To come to him with such a Frau Hulda (the name
by which he ridicules reason) “is mere devil’s roguery.”<a name="FNanchor_1313_1313" id="FNanchor_1313_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a>
In his contempt for reason he goes so far as to advocate a
new theory of the omnipresence of Christ’s body, in heaven
and everywhere on earth, in spite of the impossibility such
a thing would involve.</p>

<p>It was quite at variance with his habitual exhortations
and commands for him calmly to inform the fanatics that,
whoever does not wish to receive the Sacrament may leave
it alone. The only effect of receiving the Sacrament now
appears to him to be, that it strengthens in us the Word of
faith in Christ, and is a consolation to troubled consciences.
It is true that he proves himself a fiery advocate of the
literal sense of the words of institution and a passionate
defender of the Sacramental Presence, yet the meagre
effect he concedes to the Eucharist makes his fervour
somewhat difficult to understand, for there is no doubt that
he minimises both the graces we receive through the Sacrament
and the greatness of the gift of Christ; apart from
this he altogether excludes the sacrificial character of the
Supper. Still, his zeal for the defence of the Eucharist
against those who denied it was so great, that, out of defiance,
he was anxious to retain even the Latin wording of his
“Liturgy” and, to this end, made a pathetic appeal to the
chapter in which St. Paul speaks of the use of strange
tongues (1 Cor. xiv.), which Luther thought might be
understood of the language used in the Mass.</p>

<p>The list of feeble arguments and self-contradictions found
in this remarkable book might be indefinitely lengthened,
though, on the other hand, it also contains many a practical
and striking refutation of views held by the fanatics.</p>

<p>In the press of his personal struggle, and in spite of all his
scorn for his opponents’ “spiritism,” Luther could not
refrain from bringing forward against Carlstadt a prophecy
of the “higher spirit.” This prophecy had condemned
Carlstadt beforehand and had foretold that he would not
long share our faith; this has now been fulfilled to the
letter, so that “I cannot but understand it.”<a name="FNanchor_1314_1314" id="FNanchor_1314_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a> Unfortunately,
before this, the opposite party had discovered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
prediction against Luther, an “ancient prophecy” which
was certainly about to be fulfilled in Luther, viz. “that
the black monk must first come and cause all mischief.”<a name="FNanchor_1315_1315" id="FNanchor_1315_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a></p>

<p>As was to be expected, Luther preferred, however, to lay
greater stress on other considerations which might assist
him to gain the upper hand. He returns to his favourite
asseveration: “If what I have begun is of God, no one will
be able to hinder it; if it is not, I shall most assuredly not
uphold it.”<a name="FNanchor_1316_1316" id="FNanchor_1316_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a> But not to “uphold it” with all the force and
passion at his command, was, as a matter of fact, impossible
to him. “No one shall take it from me!” he exclaims,
almost in the same breath with the above, and though he
indeed adds “save God alone,” still he knew perfectly well
that God would not appear personally in order to wrestle
with him. Moreover, he will have it that the crucial test
had occurred long before and had entirely vindicated him.
So great a work as he had achieved could not, he assures us,
have been “built” without God’s help; not he but a higher
power was the builder, though, so far as he was concerned,
he had “in the main laboured well and rightly [this to the
Strasburg dissenters],<a name="FNanchor_1317_1317" id="FNanchor_1317_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a> so that whoever avers the contrary
cannot be a good spirit; I hope I shall have no worse luck
in the outward matters upon which these prophets are so
fond of harping.” In “outward matters,” however, he was
cautious enough to restrict his claim within his favourite
province of freedom. He calls it “spiritual freedom,” not
to make iconoclasm a duty, to leave each one at liberty to
receive, or not receive, the Sacrament, and not to insist on
the wearing of grey frocks. He is also careful not to prescribe
anything, that, by way of outward observances they
may not fall back into Popery, the whole essence of which
consists in this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Luther, however, insists all the more on the “Bible
spirit,” the spirit of the outward Word.</p>

<p>This, in spite of its subjective character, is to be set up
as a brazen shield against the private judgment of the
“heavenly prophets” and their inspirations. It is true his
opponents objected that he himself had much to learn from
the “Bible spirit,” for instance, greater meekness and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
resolution to proceed without stirring up “dangerous
enmities.” These, however, were minor matters in his eyes.
For him the “Bible spirit” was the witness and safeguard
of his treasured doctrine.</p>

<p>What we must hearken to is not the inward Word&mdash;such is
his emphatic declaration after his encounter with the fanatics,
in flat contradiction to his earlier statements (see above,
p. 4 f.)&mdash;but above all the outward Word contained in
Scripture: if we do otherwise we are simply following the
example of the “heavenly prophets.” The Pope “spoke
according to his own fancy,” paying no heed to the outward
Word, but I speak according to Scripture.<a name="FNanchor_1318_1318" id="FNanchor_1318_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a> All that was
necessary was not to pervert the Bible, as the fanatics did;
it is the devil who gives them a wrong understanding of
Scripture, indeed, according to Luther, there is no heretic
who does not make much of Scripture. “When the devil
sees that the Bible is used as a weapon against him, he runs
to Scripture and raises such confusion that people no longer
can tell who has the right interpretation. When I quote
Scripture against the Papists and fanatics, they don’t
believe me, for they have their own glosses.”<a name="FNanchor_1319_1319" id="FNanchor_1319_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a> Hence, such
at least is his implicit invitation, they must hold fast to his
gloss and no other. For I, by discovering Scripture, “have
delivered the world from the horrid darkness of Antichrist;
nor have I the faintest doubt, but am entirely convinced,
that our Evangel is the true one.”<a name="FNanchor_1320_1320" id="FNanchor_1320_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1320_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a> “The heresies and
persecutions rampant amongst us are merely that confirmation
of the truth which the New Testament predicted
(1 Cor. xi. 19), of the truth which I preach. Heresies must
needs arise,” etc. etc.</p>

<p>Finally&mdash;such is one of his main arguments against the
“heavenly prophets”&mdash;these heretical fanatics do not
preach the “chief piece of Christian doctrine”; they “do
not tell people how to get rid of sin, obtain a good conscience,
and a joyful heart at peace with God, which, really, is the
great thing. Here, if anywhere, is the sign that their spirit
is of the devil.... Of how we may obtain a good conscience
they are utterly ignorant, for they have never
experienced it.”<a name="FNanchor_1321_1321" id="FNanchor_1321_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a> He, on the other hand, thanks to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
doctrine, had, though with unheard-of efforts, won his way
to a quiet conscience, and by this impressed an infallible
stamp upon his Evangel; his own way to salvation will be
the way of all who trustfully lay hold on the merits of
Christ. Yet it is not the way for all. For the proud, and for
all who are full of self, there is the law to terrify them and
lay bare their sin. It is only to the “troubled consciences”
who tremble before the wrath of God, to the simple, the
poor, and those who are utterly cast down, that the Evangel
speaks. But these fanatics have no interior combats and
death-struggles, they neither humble themselves before God,
nor do they pray. “This I know and am certain of, that
they never commenced their undertaking by imploring God’s
help, or praying, and that, even now, their conscience would
not allow them to pray for a happy issue.”<a name="FNanchor_1322_1322" id="FNanchor_1322_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a> Not only do
they not pray, but they are simply unable to pray; they
are lost souls and belong to the devil.</p>

<p>Never let us in any single thing ever trust to our own
knowledge and our own will. “I prefer to listen to another
rather than to myself.” We cannot be sufficiently on our
guard “against the great rascal whom we bear in our
hearts.”<a name="FNanchor_1323_1323" id="FNanchor_1323_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1323_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a> The fanatics retorted: Well may you speak thus,
“you who soar aloft so high with your faith,” you who are
so full of yourself that you must needs use us as your
target; “your defiant teaching and your obstinacy” are
well known to all.<a name="FNanchor_1324_1324" id="FNanchor_1324_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a></p>

<p>Carlstadt and his fellows were not to be converted by
such outpourings as these.</p>

<p>The rebellious fanatics treated the writings directed
against them with the greatest contempt. Caspar Glatz,
who had replaced Carlstadt as Lutheran pastor at Orlamünde,
said in a report to Wittenberg: They use them in the
privy, as I myself have seen and heard from others.<a name="FNanchor_1325_1325" id="FNanchor_1325_1325"></a><a href="#Footnote_1325_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a>
Luther, too, indignantly apprises Wenceslaus Link of this:
“<i>Rustici nates libello meo purgant, sic Satan furit.</i> Thus
doth Satan rage.”<a name="FNanchor_1326_1326" id="FNanchor_1326_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1326_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>The most important change called forth in Luther by his
encounters with the fanatics was an increasing disinclination
to appeal as heretofore to any extraordinary divine illumination
or inspiration of his own. At the commencement of the
conflict he had been in the habit of telling them: “I also was
in the spirit, I also have seen spirits”; now, however, little
by little, as we shall see more plainly later (vol. iv., xxviii.
1), such assurances made room for an appeal to the “Word.”
The outward Bible-Word, the meaning of which he had
himself discovered, was now to count for everything.</p>

<p>Beneath the yoke of the Word he was anxious to compel
also his other opponents, such as Agricola, Schenk, and
Egranus, to pass.</p>

<h3>3. Johann Agricola, Jacob Schenk, and Johann Egranus</h3>

<p>Johann Agricola of Eisleben, one of the earliest and most
violent of Luther’s assistants, was desirous of carrying his
doctrine on good works and the difference between the Law
and the Gospel to its logical conclusion. His modifications
and criticism of Luther’s doctrine called forth the latter’s
vigorous denunciation. Agricola had to thank his own
restlessness, and “the burden of Luther’s superiority and
hostility,” for what he endured so long as Luther lived.<a name="FNanchor_1327_1327" id="FNanchor_1327_1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_1327_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a>
As the details of the quarrel are reserved for later consideration
(vol. v., xxix. 3), we shall here merely indicate
Luther’s behaviour by quoting a few of his utterances.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The foolish fellow was concerned about his honour,” Luther
says very characteristically of this quarrel. He was anxious
“that the Wittenbergers should be nothing and Eisleben everything.”<a name="FNanchor_1328_1328" id="FNanchor_1328_1328"></a><a href="#Footnote_1328_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a>
“He is hardened,” and nothing can be done for him;
“Agricola says, ‘I, too, have a head.’ Well, were that all that
God requires, I might say I have one too. Thus they go on in their
obstinacy and see not that they are in the wrong.... Our
Lord God evidently intends to go on worrying me yet a while so
as to defy the Papists.”<a name="FNanchor_1329_1329" id="FNanchor_1329_1329"></a><a href="#Footnote_1329_1329" class="fnanchor">[1329]</a> Elsewhere he says: “Agricola looks on
at these doings with a merry mien, and refuses to humble himself.
Yet he has submitted his recantation to me, perhaps in the
hope that I would treat him more leniently. But I shall seek the
glory of Christ and not his; I shall pillory him and his words, as a
cowardly, proud, impious man, who has done much harm to the
Church.”<a name="FNanchor_1330_1330" id="FNanchor_1330_1330"></a><a href="#Footnote_1330_1330" class="fnanchor">[1330]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Another who fell into serious disagreements with Luther
over the Antinomian question was Dr. Jacob Schenk, then
preacher at Freiberg in Saxony (afterwards Court-preacher
at Weimar). At Wittenberg his conduct began to give rise
to suspicion at the same time as Agricola’s. He was
reported to have said in a sermon: Whoever goes on preaching
the law, is possessed of the devil. The eloquence of this
man of no mean talents was as great as his aims were
strange.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">In Lauterbach’s Diary we find the following, under date October
7, 1538, concerning Luther and Schenk: At Luther’s table the
conversation turned upon Jacob Schenk, “who, in his arrogant
and lying fashion was doing all manner of things [so Luther
declared] which he afterwards was wont to deny. Wherever
he was, he raised up strife, relying on the authority of the
Prince and the applause of the people. But he will be put
to shame in the end [so Luther went on to say], just as Johann
Agricola, who enjoyed great consideration at Court and was
almost a Privy Councillor; his reputation vanished without
my having any hand in the matter. When Schenk preached
at Zeitz he gave general dissatisfaction. The wretched man
is puffed up with pride and deceives himself with new-fangled
words.... He has concealed his wickedness under a Satanic
hypocrisy and is ever aping me. Never shall I trust him again,
no, not to all eternity.”<a name="FNanchor_1331_1331" id="FNanchor_1331_1331"></a><a href="#Footnote_1331_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a></p>

<p>Lauterbach gives a striking picture of Luther’s behaviour at
his encounter with Jacob Schenk on September 11, 1538. Luther
and Jonas, after a sermon which had greatly displeased them,
paid him a visit. They found him, “sad to relate, impenitent
and unabashed, rebellious, ambitious, and perjurious.” Luther
pointed out to him his ignorance; how could he, unexperienced
as he was, and understanding neither dialectics nor rhetoric,
venture thus to oppose his teachers? Schenk replied: “I must
do so for the sake of Christ’s Blood and His dear Passion; my
own great trouble of conscience also compels me to it” (thus
adducing a motive similar to that so often alleged by Luther in his
own case). I must “fear God more than all my preceptors; for
I have a God as much as you.” Luther replied: “It may be that
you understand my doctrine perfectly, but you ought nevertheless,
for the honour of God, to honour us as the teachers who first
instructed you.” This seems to have made no impression on
Schenk. Luther’s parting shot was: “If you are torn to pieces,
may the devil lap your blood. We also are ‘in peril from false
brethren.’ Poor Freiberg [the scene of Schenk’s labours] will
never recover from this. But God, the Avenger, will destroy
the man who has defiled His temple. The proverb says: ‘Where
heart and mind both are bad, the state of a man indeed is sad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>’”
At supper, Schenk, seated at table with Luther and Jonas, began
to abuse Luther and the inhabitants of Freiberg; after saying
much that was scarcely complimentary, he added: “‘When I have
made the Court as pious as you have made the world, then my
work will be finished.’ In spite of all this impertinence he remained
seated, though his hypocritical show of humility revealed
how depraved his heart really was. When Luther got up to leave
the room Schenk attempted to start the quarrel anew.”<a name="FNanchor_1332_1332" id="FNanchor_1332_1332"></a><a href="#Footnote_1332_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a> Finally
they parted unreconciled.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Schenk subsequently led a wandering existence, ever
under suspicion as to the purity of his faith. In 1541 he
was at Leipzig and in 1543 he visited Joachim, Elector of
Brandenburg. It was given out by adversaries, such as
Melanchthon and Alberus, that he ultimately committed
suicide, driven thereto by melancholy; the statement is,
however, not otherwise confirmed,</p>

<p class="p2">Johann Wildenauer (or Silvius), the theologian, was born
at Eger in Bohemia, and hence was generally known as
Egranus. This priest, who was a man of talent and of
Humanistic culture, and an enthusiastic follower of Erasmus,
had been won over to the new teaching in the very beginning.
After having been preacher at the Marienkirche at Zwickau
until Thomas Münzer made any further stay impossible,
we find him from 1521-23 and, again, from 1533-34,
preacher of the new faith at Joachimstal, where he was one
of the predecessors of Mathesius.</p>

<p>Wildenauer was one of the most remarkable and independent
characters of the time, but an “extremely restless
spirit.”<a name="FNanchor_1333_1333" id="FNanchor_1333_1333"></a><a href="#Footnote_1333_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a> Although a Lutheran, he openly expressed his
dissatisfaction, not only with the moral conditions under
Lutheranism, but also with many points of his master’s
doctrine, particularly with his theory that faith alone
justifies, and that man cannot co-operate in the work of his
salvation. Luther became at an early date suspicious and
angry concerning him. He wrote to Joachimstal “to warn
the people against the dubious doctrines of Egranus,” as
Mathesius relates, on the strength of copies of certain letters
he had seen.<a name="FNanchor_1334_1334" id="FNanchor_1334_1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_1334_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a> The more dutiful Mathesius speaks of his
predecessor as “a Mameluke and an ungrateful pupil.”<a name="FNanchor_1335_1335" id="FNanchor_1335_1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1335_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
His fault consisted in his following the example of Erasmus,
as did in progress of time so many other admirers of the
Dutch scholar, and relinquishing more and more his former
good opinion of Luther’s person and work; with this change
his own sad experiences had not a little to do. To the
Catholic Church, which had excommunicated him, he
apparently never returned. When, in 1534, he was deprived
of his post at Joachimstal, he complained in a letter, that
he had been “driven into exile and outlawed by Papists and
Lutherans alike.”<a name="FNanchor_1336_1336" id="FNanchor_1336_1336"></a><a href="#Footnote_1336_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a></p>

<p>In that same year he published at Leipzig a work entitled
“A Christian Instruction on the righteousness of faith and
on good works,”<a name="FNanchor_1337_1337" id="FNanchor_1337_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_1337_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a> which, in spite of its bitterness, contained
many home-truths. There, apart from what he says on
doctrinal matters, we find an account of the “temptations
and trials” he had to endure for having ventured to teach
that “good works and a Christian life, side by side with
faith, are useful and necessary for securing eternal life.”<a name="FNanchor_1338_1338" id="FNanchor_1338_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a></p>

<p>About this time Luther again sent forth a challenge to
Erasmus and to all Erasmians generally who had broken
with him, Egranus included.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">He told his friends that now his business was to “purify the
Church from the brood of Erasmus” (“<i>a fœtibus eius</i>”); he was
referring particularly to Egranus, also to Crotus Rubeanus, Wicel,
[Œcolampadius, and Campanus.<a name="FNanchor_1339_1339" id="FNanchor_1339_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1339_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a> Erasmus had already
“seduced” Zwingli and now he had also “converted Egranus,
who believes just as much as he,” viz. nothing.<a name="FNanchor_1340_1340" id="FNanchor_1340_1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_1340_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a>&mdash;Egranus he
calls a “proud donkey,” who teaches that Christ must not be
exalted so high, having learnt this from Erasmus;<a name="FNanchor_1341_1341" id="FNanchor_1341_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1341_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a> “this proud
spirit declared that though Christ had earned it, yet we must
merit it.”<a name="FNanchor_1342_1342" id="FNanchor_1342_1342"></a><a href="#Footnote_1342_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a>&mdash;He had long been acquainted with this false spirit,
so he wrote in 1533 or 1534 to a Joachimstal burgher; he, like
other sectarians, was full of “devil’s venom.” “Even though no
syrup or purgative be given them, yet they cannot but expel their
poison from mouth and anus. The time will come when they will
be unable any longer to pass the matter, and then their belly
must burst like that of Judas; for they will not be able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
retain what they have stolen and devoured of [the doctrine of]
Christ.”<a name="FNanchor_1343_1343" id="FNanchor_1343_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_1343_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a></p>

<p>That Egranus finally drank himself to death with Malmsey
“is a despicable calumny, which can be traced back to
Mathesius.”<a name="FNanchor_1344_1344" id="FNanchor_1344_1344"></a><a href="#Footnote_1344_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a> In the sixteenth-century controversies it was the
usual thing on either side to calumniate opponents and to make
them die the worst death conceivable,<a name="FNanchor_1345_1345" id="FNanchor_1345_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1345_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a> and it would appear, that,
in the case of Egranus, at a very early date unfavourable reports
were circulated concerning his manner of death. His lamentable
end (“<i>misere periit</i>”), Luther likens to that of Zwingli, struck
down in the battle of Cappel by a divine judgment.<a name="FNanchor_1346_1346" id="FNanchor_1346_1346"></a><a href="#Footnote_1346_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a> His death
occurred in 1535.</p>

<p>In the “Christian Instruction,” referred to above, Egranus
had written: “The new prophets can only tell us that we are
freed from sin by Christ; what He commanded or forbade in the
Gospel that they pass over as were it not in the Gospel at all.”
“If we simply say: Christ has done everything and what we do
is of no account, then we are making too much of Christ’s share,
for we also must do something to secure our salvation. By such
words Christ is made a cloak for our sins, and, as is actually now
the case, all seek to conceal and excuse their wickedness and
viciousness under the mantle of Christ’s merits.”</p>

<p>“If such faith without works continues to be preached much
longer, the Christian religion will fall into ruins and come to a
lamentable end, and the place where this faith without works is
taught will become a Sodom and Gomorrha.”<a name="FNanchor_1347_1347" id="FNanchor_1347_1347"></a><a href="#Footnote_1347_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a></p></div>

<h3>4. Bugenhagen, Jonas and others</h3>

<p>Disagreements such as these never arose to mar the
relations between Luther and some of his other more
intimate co-workers, for instance, his friendship with
Bugenhagen and Jonas, who have been so frequently
alluded to already. He was always ready to acknowledge
in the warmest manner the great services they rendered
him in the defence and spread of his teaching, and to support
them when they stood in need of his assistance. He was
never stingy in his bestowal of praise, narrow-minded or
jealous, in his acknowledgement of the merits of friendly
fellow-preachers, or of those writers who held Lutheran
views.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>Nicholas von Amsdorf, who introduced the new faith
into Magdeburg in 1524 and there became Superintendent,
he praises for the firmness with which he confessed the faith
and for his fearless conduct generally. In Disputations he
was wont to go straight to the heart of the matter like the
“born theologian” he was; at Schmalkalden, when preaching
before the Princes and magnates, he had not shrunk
from declaring that our Evangel was intended for the weak
and oppressed and for those who feel themselves sinners,
though he could not discern any such in the audience.<a name="FNanchor_1348_1348" id="FNanchor_1348_1348"></a><a href="#Footnote_1348_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a></p>

<p>Johann Brenz, preacher in Schwäbisch-Hall since 1522,
and one of the founders of the new church system in Suabia,
was greatly lauded by Luther for his exegetical abilities.
“He is a learned and reliable man. Amongst all the
theologians of our day there is not one who knows how to
interpret and handle Holy Scripture like Brenz. When I
gaze in admiration at his spirit I almost despair of my own
powers. Certainly none of our people can do what he has
done in his exposition of the Gospel of St. John. At times,
it is true, he is carried away by his own ideas, yet he sticks
to the point and speaks conformably to the simplicity of
God’s Word.”<a name="FNanchor_1349_1349" id="FNanchor_1349_1349"></a><a href="#Footnote_1349_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a></p>

<p>Next to Melanchthon, however, the friend whom Luther
praised most highly as a “thoroughly learned and most able
man,” was Johann Bugenhagen. “He has, under most
trying circumstances, been of service to many of the
Churches.”<a name="FNanchor_1350_1350" id="FNanchor_1350_1350"></a><a href="#Footnote_1350_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">In his Preface to Bugenhagen’s Latin Commentary on the
Psalms&mdash;a work which, even in the opinion of Protestant
theologians, “leaves much to be desired”<a name="FNanchor_1351_1351" id="FNanchor_1351_1351"></a><a href="#Footnote_1351_1351" class="fnanchor">[1351]</a> from the “point of
view of learning,” and which in reality is merely a sort of
polemical work of edification, written from the standpoint of the
new faith&mdash;Luther declared, that the spirit of Christ had at
length unlocked the Psalter through Bugenhagen; every teacher
must admit that now “the spirit was revealing secrets hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
for ages.” “I venture to assert that the first person on earth
to give an explanation of the Book of Psalms is Pomeranus.
Almost all earlier writers have introduced their own views into
the book, but here the judgment of the spirit will teach you
wondrous things.”<a name="FNanchor_1352_1352" id="FNanchor_1352_1352"></a><a href="#Footnote_1352_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a></p>

<p>Yet at the very outset, in the first verse of the Psalms, instead
of a learned commentary, we find Bugenhagen expounding the
new belief, and attacking the alleged self-righteousness of
Catholicism, termed by him the “<i>cathedra pestilentiæ</i>”; he even
relates at length his conversion to Lutheranism, which had given
scandal “to those not yet enlightened by the sun of the Evangel.”<a name="FNanchor_1353_1353" id="FNanchor_1353_1353"></a><a href="#Footnote_1353_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a>
They were no longer to wait for the completion of his own
Commentary on the Psalms, Luther concludes, since now&mdash;in
place of poor Luther&mdash;David, Isaias, Paul, and John were themselves
speaking to the reader.</p>

<p>“He had no clear perception of the defects of Bugenhagen’s
exegetical method,” remarks O. Albrecht, the editor of the above
Preface in the Weimar edition of Luther’s works.<a name="FNanchor_1354_1354" id="FNanchor_1354_1354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1354_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a> The explanation
of this “uncalled-for praise,” as Albrecht terms it, is to be
found in the feeling expressed by Luther in the first sentence of
the Preface: At the present time God had caused His Word to
shine like crystal, whereas of yore there prevailed only chill and
dismal mists.</p></div>

<p class="p1">The truth is that few of Luther’s assistants promoted his
cause with such devotion and determination combined as
did Pomeranus, who, for all his zeal, was both practical
and sober in his ways. Such were his achievements for the
cause, that Luther greets him in the superscription of a
letter as “Bishop of the Church of Wittenberg, Legate of
Christ’s face and heart to Denmark, my brother and my
master.” He thus explains the words “<i>legatus a facie et a
corde</i>”: “the Pope boasts of his ‘<i>legati a latere</i>,’ I boast of
my pious preachers ‘<i>a facie et a corde</i>.’”<a name="FNanchor_1355_1355" id="FNanchor_1355_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1355_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a> Luther was in
the habit of putting Bugenhagen on the same footing with
himself and Melanchthon: Luther, Philip, and Pomeranus
will support the Evangel as long as they are there, he says,
but after this there will come a fall (“<i>fiet lapsus</i>”).<a name="FNanchor_1356_1356" id="FNanchor_1356_1356"></a><a href="#Footnote_1356_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a> Let
those braggarts who pretend they know better “come to
me, to Philip, and to Pomeranus ... then they will be
nicely confounded.”<a name="FNanchor_1357_1357" id="FNanchor_1357_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1357_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a> Köstlin is, however, rightly of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
opinion that, as compared with Luther and Melanchthon,
Bugenhagen was “merely a subordinate, though endowed
by nature with considerable powers of mind and body.”<a name="FNanchor_1358_1358" id="FNanchor_1358_1358"></a><a href="#Footnote_1358_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a>
Yet the sun of Luther’s favour shone upon him. Agricola,
“the poor fellow,” says Luther, “looks down on Pomeranus,
but the latter is a great theologian and has plenty nerve for
his work (‘<i>multum habet nervorum</i>’); Agricola, of course,
would make himself out to be more learned than Master Philip
or I.”<a name="FNanchor_1359_1359" id="FNanchor_1359_1359"></a><a href="#Footnote_1359_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a> “Pomeranus is a splendid professor”; “his sermons
are full of wealth.”<a name="FNanchor_1360_1360" id="FNanchor_1360_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_1360_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a> The truth is that the “wealth,” or rather
expansiveness, of his discourses was so great that Luther had
to reprove him severely for the length of his sermons.</p>

<p>Johann Bugenhagen, called Pommer or Pomeranus
because he hailed from Wollin in Pomerania, after two years
spent at the University of Greifswald and a further course
devoted mainly to Humanist studies, was ordained priest
by the Bishop of Cammin, when “as yet he probably had
not begun to study theology.”<a name="FNanchor_1361_1361" id="FNanchor_1361_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1361_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a> At the College at Treptow
he earned respect as professor of Humanism and as Rector;
in his desire to further the better theology advocated by
Erasmus he took to studying the Bible, and, on Luther’s
appearance, was soon won over to the cause, though on first
reading Luther’s work “On the Babylonish Captivity,” he
“had been repelled by the palpable heresies” it contained.
He settled at Wittenberg, delivered private lectures on the
Psalms, and married, on October 13, 1522, a servant-maid
of Hieronymus Schurf, the lawyer; in the following year he
was inducted at the Schlosskirche as parish-priest of
Wittenberg by the magistrates, acting together with Luther.
In defiance of right and justice and of the murmurs raised,
Luther, from the pulpit, proclaimed him pastor, thus overruling
the objections of the Chapter; his choice by the
board of magistrates “and by the congregation agreeably
with the evangelical teaching of Paul,” Luther held to be
quite sufficient.<a name="FNanchor_1362_1362" id="FNanchor_1362_1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1362_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a></p>

<p>As pastor, Bugenhagen displayed great energy not merely
in preaching to and instructing the people, but in furthering
in every way the spread of Lutheranism in the civic and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
social life of the Electorate. His practical talents made him
eventually the apostle of the new Church, even beyond the
confines of Saxony. He successively introduced or organised
it in Brunswick, Hamburg, Lübeck, and in Pomerania, his
own country; then in Denmark, from 1537-39, where he
fixed his residence at Copenhagen. Two main features are
apparent in all he did; everywhere the new Churches were
established on a strictly civil basis, and, so far as the new
religion allowed of it, the old Catholic forms were retained.</p>

<p>In his indefatigable and arduous undertakings Bugenhagen
made himself one with Luther, and became, so to speak,
a replica of his master. In his scrupulous observance
of Luther’s doctrine he was to be outdone by none, save
possibly by Amsdorf; in rudeness and want of consideration
where the new Evangel was concerned, and in his whole
way of thinking, he stood nearest to Luther, the only
difference being, that, in his discourses and writings we
miss Luther’s imagination and feeling. In the literary field,
in addition to the Commentary on the Psalms and other
similar writings, he distinguished himself by a work in
vindication of the new preaching, addressed to the city of
Hamburg and entitled: “Von dem Christen-loven und den
rechten guden Werken” (1526), also by the share he took,
with Melanchthon and Cruciger, in Luther’s German
translation of the Bible, and his labours in connection with
the Low-Saxon version. Most important of all, however,
were his Church-constitutions. Bugenhagen died at Wittenberg
on April 20, 1558, after having already lost his sight&mdash;broken
down by the bitter trials which had come on him
subsequent to Luther’s death.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Such was Luther’s confidence in his friend and appreciation of
his power, that, during Bugenhagen’s prolonged absence, we
often find Luther expressing his desire to see him again by his
side and in charge of the Wittenberg pastorate. “Your absence,”
so in 1531 he wrote to him at Lübeck, “is greatly felt by us. I
am overburdened with work and my health is not good. I am
neglecting the Church-accounts, and the shepherd should be here.
I cannot attend to it. The world remains the world and the
devil is its God.... Since the world refuses to allow itself to be
saved, let it perish. Greet your Eve and Sara in my name and
that of my wife and give greetings to all our friends.”<a name="FNanchor_1363_1363" id="FNanchor_1363_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a></p>

<p>When Bugenhagen was at Wittenberg Luther loved to open
to him the secret recesses of his heart, especially when suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
from “temptations.” Frequently he even aroused in Bugenhagen a
sort of echo of his own feelings, which shows us how close a tie
existed between them, and gives us an idea of the kind of suggestion
Luther was wont to exercise over those who surrendered
themselves to his influence.</p>

<p>Bugenhagen, like Luther, was not conscious of any good-will
or merit of his own, but&mdash;apart from the merits of Christ with
which we are bedecked&mdash;merely of the oppression arising from
his “great weakness” and “secret idolatry against the first
Table of the Law of Moses.” Hence, when Luther, in June, 1540,
complained that Agricola was after some righteousness of his
own, whereas he (Luther) could find nothing of the sort in himself,
Bugenhagen at once chimed in with the assurance that he
was no less unable to discover any such thing in himself.<a name="FNanchor_1364_1364" id="FNanchor_1364_1364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1364_1364" class="fnanchor">[1364]</a></p>

<p>Luther’s anger against the fanatics and Sacramentarians was
imbibed by Bugenhagen. To him and his other Table-guests
Luther complained that his adversaries, Carlstadt, Grickel and
Jeckel (i.e. Agricola and Jacob Schenk), were ignorant braggarts;
they accuse us of want of charity because we will not allow
them to have their own way, though we read in Paul: “A man
that is a heretic avoid.” Bugenhagen was at once ready to
propose a drastic remedy. “Doctor, we should do what is
commanded in Deuteronomy [xiii. 5 ff.], where Moses says they
should be put to death.” Whereupon Luther replied: “Quite
so, and the reason is given in the same text: It is better to
make away with a man than with God.”<a name="FNanchor_1365_1365" id="FNanchor_1365_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a> Bugenhagen was
also the first to take up his pen in Luther’s defence<a name="FNanchor_1366_1366" id="FNanchor_1366_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a> when the
Swiss heresy concerning the doctrine of the Supper began to
be noised abroad owing to a letter of Zwingli’s to Alber at Reutlingen,
and to his book, “<i>Commentarius de vera et falsa religione</i>,”
of March, 1525. When Melanchthon showed signs of inclining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
towards the Zwinglian doctrine of the Sacrament, there was soon
a rumour at Wittenberg that “Melanchthon and Pomeranus
have fallen out badly on the Article concerning the Supper,” and
an apprehension of “dreadful dissensions amongst the foremost
theologians.”<a name="FNanchor_1367_1367" id="FNanchor_1367_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1367_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a></p>

<p>In 1532 Luther declared: There must be some ready to show
a “brave front” to the devil; “there must be some in the
Church as ready to slap Satan, as we three [Luther, Melanchthon,
and Bugenhagen]; but not all are able or willing to endure
this.”<a name="FNanchor_1368_1368" id="FNanchor_1368_1368"></a><a href="#Footnote_1368_1368" class="fnanchor">[1368]</a> And on another occasion he described, in Bugenhagen’s
presence, how he was wont cynically to mock the devil when “he
comes by night to worry me ... by bringing up my sins”;
Satan did not, however, torment him about his really grave sins,
such as his “celebration of Mass and provocation of God [in the
religious life].” “May God preserve me from that! For were
I to realise keenly how great these sins were, the horror of it
would kill me!” It was on the occasion of this fantastic outburst,
employed by Luther to quiet his conscience, that Bugenhagen,
not to be outdone in coarseness, uttered the words already
recorded (above, p. 178).<a name="FNanchor_1369_1369" id="FNanchor_1369_1369"></a><a href="#Footnote_1369_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a></p>

<p>The spiritual kinship between Luther and Bugenhagen produced
in the latter a similar liking for coarse language. He was
much addicted to the use of strong expressions, witness, for
instance, his saying that friars wore ropes around their waists
that we might have wherewith to hang them.<a name="FNanchor_1370_1370" id="FNanchor_1370_1370"></a><a href="#Footnote_1370_1370" class="fnanchor">[1370]</a></p>

<p>In his most severe temptations Luther found consolation in
the words of comfort spoken by the pastor of Wittenberg, and he
assures us he was often refreshed by such exhortations, the
memory of which he was slow to lose.<a name="FNanchor_1371_1371" id="FNanchor_1371_1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1371_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a> Bugenhagen assisted him
during his severe illness in 1527, and again in the other attack
some ten years later. On the latter occasion he summoned his
friend to Gotha, made his confession to him, so he says, and
commended the “Church and his family” to his care.<a name="FNanchor_1372_1372" id="FNanchor_1372_1372"></a><a href="#Footnote_1372_1372" class="fnanchor">[1372]</a> When
separated they were in the habit of begging each other’s prayers.</p>

<p>In his letters Bugenhagen recounts to Luther the success of
his labours, in order to afford him pleasure, giving due thanks to
God. Somewhat strange is the account he sent Luther of an
encounter he had at Lübeck with a girl supposed to be possessed
by the devil; through her lips the devil had given
testimony to him just as at Ephesus, so the Acts of the Apostles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
tell us, he had borne witness to the power of Jesus and Paul.<a name="FNanchor_1373_1373" id="FNanchor_1373_1373"></a><a href="#Footnote_1373_1373" class="fnanchor">[1373]</a>
Hardly had he come to the town and visited the girl than the
devil, speaking through her, called him by name (we must not
forget that her parents, at least, were acquainted with Bugenhagen)
and declared his coming to Lübeck to be quite uncalled
for. That, in spite of his prayers and tears, he was unable to
expel the devil, he himself admits.<a name="FNanchor_1374_1374" id="FNanchor_1374_1374"></a><a href="#Footnote_1374_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a> The account of the incident,
written down by him soon after his arrival at Lübeck, and before
he had properly inquired into the case, was soon published under
a curious title.<a name="FNanchor_1375_1375" id="FNanchor_1375_1375"></a><a href="#Footnote_1375_1375" class="fnanchor">[1375]</a> So much did Luther think of the encounter with
this hysterical or mentally deranged girl,<a name="FNanchor_1376_1376" id="FNanchor_1376_1376"></a><a href="#Footnote_1376_1376" class="fnanchor">[1376]</a> that he wrote: “Satan
is giving Pomeranus a great deal to do at Lübeck with a maid
who is possessed. The cunning demon is planning marvels.”
This, when forwarding from the Coburg to Wenceslaus Link,
preacher at Nuremberg, the account he had received.<a name="FNanchor_1377_1377" id="FNanchor_1377_1377"></a><a href="#Footnote_1377_1377" class="fnanchor">[1377]</a> In 1536
Bugenhagen related at table, during the conciliation meetings
held at Wittenberg, the encounters he had had in Lübeck and
Brunswick with “delivered demoniacs.”<a name="FNanchor_1378_1378" id="FNanchor_1378_1378"></a><a href="#Footnote_1378_1378" class="fnanchor">[1378]</a></p>

<p>Luther on his side gave his friend, when busy abroad, frequent
tidings of the state of things at Wittenberg. In 1537 he sent to
him, at Copenhagen, an account of a nasty trick played by Paul
Heintz, a professor at the University of Wittenberg, “greatly
to the detriment of the town and University.” The latter, in
order to possess himself of an inheritance, had given out that a
youthful stepson of his was dead, and had caused a dog to be
solemnly buried in his place with all the usual rites. “The
Master’s drama makes me almost burst with rage.” If these
lawyers (who in Luther’s opinion treated the case too leniently)
“look upon the disgrace to our Church as a small matter,” he
writes, to Bugenhagen, “I will show them a bit of the true
Luther (‘<i>ero, Deo volente, Lutherus in hac causa</i>’).”<a name="FNanchor_1379_1379" id="FNanchor_1379_1379"></a><a href="#Footnote_1379_1379" class="fnanchor">[1379]</a> He did
actually write a furious letter to the Elector to secure the
severe punishment of the offender, who has caused us “to be
jeered at everywhere as dogs’ undertakers”; the lawyers, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
in the Pope’s or the devil’s name had shown themselves lenient,
he would denounce from the pulpit.<a name="FNanchor_1380_1380" id="FNanchor_1380_1380"></a><a href="#Footnote_1380_1380" class="fnanchor">[1380]</a> To Magister Johann Saxo,
who in turn related it to Bugenhagen, he declared, that, should
the burial of the dog with all the rites of the Church be proved
to have taken place, then “Paul would pay for it with his neck”
on account of the mockery of religion involved.<a name="FNanchor_1381_1381" id="FNanchor_1381_1381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1381_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a> Even later
Luther declared: “I should have liked to have written his death-sentence”;
he added, however, that the culprit had really
“buried the dog in order to drive away the plague.”<a name="FNanchor_1382_1382" id="FNanchor_1382_1382"></a><a href="#Footnote_1382_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a></p>

<p>Possessed, like Luther, by a positive craze for seeing diabolical
intervention everywhere, Bugenhagen shared his superstitions
to the full. He it was who knew how to expel the devil from the
churn by what Luther termed the “best” method, which
certainly was the coarsest imaginable.<a name="FNanchor_1383_1383" id="FNanchor_1383_1383"></a><a href="#Footnote_1383_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a> When, in December,
1536, a storm broke over Wittenberg he vied with Luther in
declaring, that since it was quite out of the order of nature, it
must be altogether satanic (“<i>plane sathanicum</i>”).<a name="FNanchor_1384_1384" id="FNanchor_1384_1384"></a><a href="#Footnote_1384_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a></p>

<p>He discerned the work of the devil just as clearly in the persistence
of Catholicism and its resistance to Lutheranism.
“Dear Lord Jesus Christ,” he writes, “arise with Thy Holy
Angels and thrust down into the abyss of hell the diabolical
murder and blasphemy of Antichrist.”<a name="FNanchor_1385_1385" id="FNanchor_1385_1385"></a><a href="#Footnote_1385_1385" class="fnanchor">[1385]</a> Elsewhere he prays in
similar fashion, “that God would put to shame the devil’s
doctrines and idolatries of the Pope and save poor people from
the errors of Antichrist.”<a name="FNanchor_1386_1386" id="FNanchor_1386_1386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1386_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a> Among all the qualities he had
acquired from Luther, his patron and model, this hatred&mdash;which
the Sectarians of the new faith who differed from Luther were
also made to feel&mdash;is perhaps the most striking. In his case,
however, fanaticism was tempered with greater coolness and
calculation. For calm obstinacy Bugenhagen in many ways
recalls Calvin.</p>

<p>When Superintendent of the Saxon Electorate he introduced
into the Litanies a new petition: “From the blasphemy, cruel
murder and uncleanness of Thine enemies the Turk and the
Pope, graciously deliver us.”<a name="FNanchor_1387_1387" id="FNanchor_1387_1387"></a><a href="#Footnote_1387_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a></p>

<p>With delight he was able to write to Luther from Denmark,<a name="FNanchor_1388_1388" id="FNanchor_1388_1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1388_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a>
that the Mass was forbidden throughout the country and that
the mendicant Friars had been driven over the borders as
“sedition-mongers” and “blasphemers” because they refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
to accept the King’s offers (“some of them were hanged”).<a name="FNanchor_1389_1389" id="FNanchor_1389_1389"></a><a href="#Footnote_1389_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a>
The Canons had everywhere been ordered to attend the Lutheran
Communion on festivals; the four thousand parishes had now
to be preserved in the new faith which had dawned upon the
land. Bugenhagen, on August 12, 1537, a few weeks after his
arrival, vested in alb and cope, and with great ecclesiastical
pomp, had placed the crown on the head of King Christian III.
who had already given the Catholics a foretaste of what was to
come and had caused all the bishops to be imprisoned.</p>

<p>“All proceeds merrily,” Luther told Bucer on December 6,
“God is working through Pomeranus; he crowned the King
and Queen like a true bishop. He has given a new span of life to
the University [of Copenhagen].”<a name="FNanchor_1390_1390" id="FNanchor_1390_1390"></a><a href="#Footnote_1390_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a> Bugenhagen was inexorable
in his extirpation of the worship of “Antichrist” in Denmark,
even down to the smallest details. To the King, concerning a
statue of Pope St. Lucius in the Cathedral Church at Roskilde,
he wrote, that this must be removed; it was an exact representation
of the Pauline prophecy concerning Antichrist; the sword,
which the Pope carried in his hand as the symbol of his death,
Bugenhagen regarded as emblematic of the cruelty of the Popes,
who now preferred to cut off the heads of others and to arrogate
to themselves authority over all kings and rulers; if a true likeness
of the Pope was really wanted, then he would have to be
represented as a devil with claws and a fiendish countenance,
and be decked out in a golden mantle, a staff, a sword and three
crowns; from such a book the laity would be able to read the
truth.<a name="FNanchor_1391_1391" id="FNanchor_1391_1391"></a><a href="#Footnote_1391_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Justus Jonas, who, of all his acquaintances, remained
longest with Luther at Wittenberg, like Bugenhagen, bestowed
upon the master his enduring veneration and friendship.
His numerous translations of Luther’s works are in
themselves a proof of his warm attachment to his ideas and
of his rare affinity to him. He, next to Melanchthon and
Bugenhagen, was the clearest-headed and most active
assistant in the affairs of Wittenberg, and his name frequently
appears, together with those of Luther and the two
other intimates, among the signatures appended to memoranda
dealing with matters ecclesiastical.</p>

<p>To the close relationship between Luther and Jonas many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
interesting details preserved in the records remain to
attest.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Jonas once dubbed Luther a Demosthenes of rhetoric.<a name="FNanchor_1392_1392" id="FNanchor_1392_1392"></a><a href="#Footnote_1392_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a> Luther
in his turn praised Jonas not merely for his translations, but also
for his sermons; he had all the gifts of a good orator, “save
that he cleared his throat too often.”<a name="FNanchor_1393_1393" id="FNanchor_1393_1393"></a><a href="#Footnote_1393_1393" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a> Yet he also accuses him
of conceit for declaring that “he knew all that was contained in
Holy Scripture” and also for his annoyance and surprise at the
doubts raised concerning the above assertion.<a name="FNanchor_1394_1394" id="FNanchor_1394_1394"></a><a href="#Footnote_1394_1394" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the bitter hostility displayed by Jonas
towards all Luther’s enemies, pleased the latter. Jonas, taking
up the thread of the conversation, remarked on one occasion to
the younger guests at Luther’s table: “Remember this definition:
A Papist is a liar and a murderer, or the devil himself.
They are not to be trusted in the least, for they thirst after our
blood.”<a name="FNanchor_1395_1395" id="FNanchor_1395_1395"></a><a href="#Footnote_1395_1395" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a></p>

<p>His opinion of Jacob Schenk coincided with that of
Luther: His “head is full of confused notions”; he was as
“poison” amongst the Wittenberg theologians, so that Bugenhagen
did well in refusing him his daughter in marriage.<a name="FNanchor_1396_1396" id="FNanchor_1396_1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_1396_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a> Of
Agricola he remarked playfully, when the latter had uttered the
word “<i>oportet</i>” (it must be): “The ‘must’ must be removed;
the salt has got into it and we refuse to take it.” Whereupon
Luther replied: “He must swallow the ‘must’ but I shall put
such salt into it that he will want to spit it out again.”<a name="FNanchor_1397_1397" id="FNanchor_1397_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1397_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a> No one,
so well as Jonas, knew how to cheer up Luther, hence Katey
sometimes invited him to table secretly.<a name="FNanchor_1398_1398" id="FNanchor_1398_1398"></a><a href="#Footnote_1398_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a> It is true that his
chatter sometimes proved tiresome to the other guests, for one
of them, viz. Cordatus, laments that he interrupted Luther’s
best sayings with his endless talk.<a name="FNanchor_1399_1399" id="FNanchor_1399_1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_1399_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a> The truth is, of course, that
the pupils were anxious to drink in words from Luther’s own
lips. Luther for his part encouraged his friend when the latter
was oppressed by illness or interior anxieties. Jonas suffered
from calculus, and, during one of his attacks, Luther said to him:
“Your illness keeps you watchful and troubled, it is of more use
to you than ten silver mines. God knows how to direct the lives
of His own people and we must obey Him, each one according
to our calling. Beloved God, how is Thy Church distracted both
within and without!”<a name="FNanchor_1400_1400" id="FNanchor_1400_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1400_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a> When Jonas on one occasion, being
already unwell, was greatly troubled with scruples of conscience
and doubts about the faith (“<i>tentatus gravissime</i>”), Luther sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
him, all written out, the consoling words with which he himself
was wont to find comfort in similar circumstances: “Have I not
been found worthy to be called to the service of the Word and
been commanded, under pain of Thine everlasting displeasure,
to believe what has been revealed to me and in no way to doubt
it?... Act manfully and strengthen your heart, all ye that hope
in God.”<a name="FNanchor_1401_1401" id="FNanchor_1401_1401"></a><a href="#Footnote_1401_1401" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a></p>

<p>In the matter of faith Jonas was easily contented, and, for this,
Luther praised him; since a man could not comprehend the
Articles, it was sufficient for him to begin with a mere assent
(“<i>ut incipiamus tantum assentiri</i>”). This theology actually
appealed to Luther so much that he exclaimed: “Yes, dear Dr.
Jonas, if a man could believe it as it stands, his heart would burst
for joy! That is sure. Hence we shall never attain to its comprehension.”<a name="FNanchor_1402_1402" id="FNanchor_1402_1402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1402_1402" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a>
On Ascension Day, 1540, Luther’s pupils wrote
down these words which fell from his lips: “I am fond of Jonas,
but if he were to ascend up to heaven and be taken from us, what
should I then think?... Strange, I cannot understand it and
cannot believe it, and yet all the Apostles believed.... Oh, if
only a man could believe it!”<a name="FNanchor_1403_1403" id="FNanchor_1403_1403"></a><a href="#Footnote_1403_1403" class="fnanchor">[1403]</a></p>

<p>Jonas found the faith amongst the country people around
Wittenberg so feeble and barren of fruit, that, on one occasion,
he complained of it with great anger. Luther sought to pacify
him: God’s chastisement will fall upon those peasants in due
time; God is strong enough to deal with them. He added, however,
admitting that Jonas was right: “Is it not a disgrace that
in the whole Wittenberg district only one peasant can be found
in all the villages who seriously exhorts his household in the
Word of God and the Catechism? The others are all going to
the devil!”<a name="FNanchor_1404_1404" id="FNanchor_1404_1404"></a><a href="#Footnote_1404_1404" class="fnanchor">[1404]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Justus Jonas, whose real name was Jodocus (Jobst) Koch,
was a native of Nordhausen in the province of Saxony. He,
like Bugenhagen, could not boast of a theological education
as he had devoted himself to jurisprudence, and, as an
enthusiastic Erasmian, to Humanism. In 1514 or 1515 he
became priest at Erfurt, and in 1518 Doctor of Civil and
Canon Law, at the same time securing a comfortable canonry.
He attached himself to Luther during the latter’s journey
to Worms, and in July, 1521, migrated to Wittenberg, where
he lectured at the University on Canon Law and also on
theology, after having been duly promoted to the dignity of
Doctor in the theological Faculty; at the same time he was
provost of the Schlosskirche.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1522 he married a Wittenberg girl, and, in the following
year, vindicated this step against Johann Faber in “<i>Adv.
J. Fabrum, scortationis patronum, pro coniugio sacerdotali</i>,”
just as Bugenhagen after his marriage had found occasion
to defend in print priestly matrimony. In 1523 he lectured
on Romans. Of his publications his translations of Luther’s
works were particularly prized.</p>

<p>His practical mind, his schooling in the law, and his
business abilities, no less than the friendship of Luther
bestowed upon a man so ready with the pen, procured for
him his nomination as dean of the theological Faculty; this
position he retained from 1523 till 1533. Jonas, the “theologian
by choice,” as Luther termed him in contradistinction
to Amsdorf, the “theologian by nature,” took part in
all the important events connected with Lutheranism, in the
Conference at Marburg, the Diet of Augsburg and the
Visitations in the Saxon Electorate from 1528 onwards, also
in the introduction of the innovations into the Duchy of
Saxony in 1539. In 1541 he introduced the new church-system
in the town of Halle, which till then had been the
residence of the Cardinal-Elector, Albert of Mayence. From
the time of the War of Schmalkalden and the misfortunes
which ensued, his interior troubles grew into a mental
malady. Melanchthon speaks of his “<i>animus ægrotus</i>.”
His was a form of the “<i>morbus melancholicus</i>”<a name="FNanchor_1405_1405" id="FNanchor_1405_1405"></a><a href="#Footnote_1405_1405" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a> which we
meet with so often at that time amongst disappointed and
broken-down men within the Protestant fold, and which was
unquestionably due to religious troubles. According to the
report of one Protestant, Cyriacus Schnauss (1556), and of
a certain anonymous writer, his death († October 9, 1555),<a name="FNanchor_1406_1406" id="FNanchor_1406_1406"></a><a href="#Footnote_1406_1406" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a>
was happier than his life. To the darker side of his character
belongs the malicious and personal nature of his
polemics, as experienced, for instance, by Johann Faber
and Wicel, whom he attacked with the weapon of calumny,
and his “constant, often petty, concern in the increase of
his income.”<a name="FNanchor_1407_1407" id="FNanchor_1407_1407"></a><a href="#Footnote_1407_1407" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">ATTEMPTS AT UNION IN VIEW OF THE PROPOSED COUNCIL</p>

<h3>1. Zürich, Münster, the Wittenberg Concord, 1536</h3>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">The</span> tension between Luther and the Swiss theologians grew
ever greater after Zwingli’s death. Zwingli’s successors
complained bitterly of the unkind treatment and the
reprobation meted out at Wittenberg to themselves, as well
as to Zwingli’s memory, and their doctrines.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Leo Judæ, one of the leaders of the Swiss party, writing in
1534 to Bucer, a kindred spirit, concerning the latter’s rough
treatment of Schwenckfeld, takes the opportunity to voice his
bitter grudge against Luther: “If it is right to oppose Schwenckfeld,
why do we not write in the same way against Luther? Why
do we not issue a proclamation warning people against him,
seeing that he advocates theories, not only on the Sacrament
but on other matters too, which are utterly at variance with Holy
Scripture? Yet he hands us over to Satan and decrees our
exclusion.”<a name="FNanchor_1408_1408" id="FNanchor_1408_1408"></a><a href="#Footnote_1408_1408" class="fnanchor">[1408]</a></p>

<p>Martin Bucer himself complained in 1534 to his Zwinglian
friend Bullinger: “The fury is intolerable with which Luther
storms and rages against everyone who he imagines differs from
him, even though not actually an opponent. Thus he curses the
most pious men and those who have been of the greatest service
to the Church. It is this alone which has brought me into the
arena and induced me to join my voice to yours in this controversy
on the Sacrament.”<a name="FNanchor_1409_1409" id="FNanchor_1409_1409"></a><a href="#Footnote_1409_1409" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a></p>

<p>Heinrich Bullinger, on whom, after Zwingli’s death, devolved
the leadership of the Swiss innovators, wrote later to Bucer:
“Luther’s rude hostility might be allowed to pass would he but
leave intact respect for Holy Scripture.... To such lengths has
this man’s proud spirit carried him, while all the preachers and
ministers worship his writings as so many oracles, and extol his
spirit as apostolic, of whose fulness all have received. What has
already taken place leads us to apprehend that this man will
eventually bring great misfortune upon the Church.”<a name="FNanchor_1410_1410" id="FNanchor_1410_1410"></a><a href="#Footnote_1410_1410" class="fnanchor">[1410]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Just as Luther’s work differed from the religious innovations
in Switzerland, so it differed equally, or even more,
from that of the Anabaptists, despite the fact that the latter
traced their origin to Luther’s doctrine of the Bible as the
one source of faith, and were largely indebted to him for the
stress he had laid on the inward Word.<a name="FNanchor_1411_1411" id="FNanchor_1411_1411"></a><a href="#Footnote_1411_1411" class="fnanchor">[1411]</a> “The Anabaptist
movement was a product of the religious innovations of the
sixteenth century,” “the fanatical sect an outcome of the so-called
Reformation.”<a name="FNanchor_1412_1412" id="FNanchor_1412_1412"></a><a href="#Footnote_1412_1412" class="fnanchor">[1412]</a> Notwithstanding the severe persecution
they encountered, particularly in Switzerland and in
the German uplands, they soon spread throughout other
parts of Germany, thanks chiefly to the attractions of their
conventicle system. An Imperial mandate of January 4,
1528, imposed the death penalty on Anabaptist heretics,
their sacrilegious repetition of baptism being taken as
equivalent to a denial of this sacrament and therefore as a
capital offence against religion.</p>

<p>The growth of the Anabaptist heresy, in spite of all
measures of repression, filled Luther with astonishment,
but its explanation is to be found not only in the religious
subjectivism let loose among the masses, but also in the
fact, that, many elements of revolt smouldering even before
Luther’s day helped to further the Anabaptist conflagration.
The fanatics also gained many adherents among those who
were disappointed in Luther owing to their hopes that he
would ameliorate morals not being realised; instead of
returning to the true Church they preferred to put their
trust in these new sects, thinking that their outward rigour
was a guarantee that they would amend the life of the
people. The popular preaching and ways of the Anabaptist
missioners, recalling the apostolic age of the Church, had a
powerful effect upon those of the lower classes who had
religious leanings; the sufferings and persecution they
endured with such constancy also earned them admiration
and sympathy. The sectarians were proud of “the self-sacrificing
brotherly love existing in their communities, so
different from the stress laid upon a faith only too often
quite barren of good works.”<a name="FNanchor_1413_1413" id="FNanchor_1413_1413"></a><a href="#Footnote_1413_1413" class="fnanchor">[1413]</a></p>

<p>They were so firm in their repudiation of the Lutheran
doctrine of Justification and held fast so frankly to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
Catholic principle of the necessity of man’s co-operation in
order to secure God’s pardon, that Luther angrily classed
them with the Papists: “They are foxes,” he wrote, “who
are tied to the Papists by their tails, though the head is
different; they behave outwardly as though they were their
greatest enemies, and yet they share with them the same
heresy against Christ our only Saviour, Who alone is our
Righteousness.”<a name="FNanchor_1414_1414" id="FNanchor_1414_1414"></a><a href="#Footnote_1414_1414" class="fnanchor">[1414]</a> The Anabaptists also opposed the
Lutheran doctrine of the Supper, denying, like the Zwinglians,
the Real Presence. Their congregations, however,
differed vastly both in belief and in observance. To all
intents and purposes their strictness was merely outward,
serving to cloak the vices of their lives and their frivolous
enjoyment of the “freedom of the Gospel.”</p>

<p>Luther’s hostility to the Anabaptists was in many
respects of service to Lutheranism; it was inspired and
promoted by the law of self-preservation. The culmination
of the movement at Münster, in Westphalia, showed that the
Wittenberger’s instinct had not erred. It is true, however,
that Luther’s harsh and repellent conduct towards the
Anabaptist sects caused the loss to the Protestants of much
that was good which might well have been retained had
he shown a little more consideration at least for the better
minds among the “fanatics”; their criticism might have
done much to remedy what was really amiss.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">When, in 1534, the Anabaptists became all-powerful at
Münster, and that under their very worst form, they made haste
to attack Luther. He, of course, was in duty bound to disapprove
of their fearsome excesses, particularly when the freedom of the
Evangel degenerated into obligatory polygamy and the most
revolting service of the flesh. The seditious spirits, in their hatred,
declared that “there are two false prophets, the Pope and Luther,
but that, of the two, Luther is the worse.”<a name="FNanchor_1415_1415" id="FNanchor_1415_1415"></a><a href="#Footnote_1415_1415" class="fnanchor">[1415]</a> Luther, on his side,
retorted: “Alas, what can I write of these wretched creatures
at Münster? It is perfectly evident that the devil reigns there
in person, yea, one devil sits on the back of another, like the
toads do.”<a name="FNanchor_1416_1416" id="FNanchor_1416_1416"></a><a href="#Footnote_1416_1416" class="fnanchor">[1416]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>After the siege of Münster had closed in its capture on June
25, 1535, and the reign of terror had been brought to an end by
the execution of the leaders, viz. Johann of Leyden and his
friends, some of Luther’s followers turned their attention to the
Sacramentarian Zwinglians of Switzerland and South Germany,
in the hope that some basis might be found for union.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Paul III. had ascended the Papal throne in 1534. On his
showing a real intention to summon an [Œcumenical Council
in order to put an end to the religious schism, the Reformers
began to feel keenly how necessary it was to unite for the
purpose of offering practical resistance to their common foe,
viz. Catholicism. The political situation was likewise
favourable to such efforts. The Nuremberg truce in 1532
had expressly been intended to last only for a limited
period, hence the necessity to find new means to make their
position secure and increase their numbers.</p>

<p>In 1535 a star of hope which seemed to forebode some
agreement rose on the horizon. On this Luther wrote as
follows to a trusted friend in August: “An attempt is
being made, with great hopes and yearning, to come to some
agreement (‘<i>concordia</i>’) between ourselves and the Sacramentarians.
Christ grant it to be realised and of His
Goodness remove that great scandal so that strong measures
may not be necessary as at Münster.”<a name="FNanchor_1417_1417" id="FNanchor_1417_1417"></a><a href="#Footnote_1417_1417" class="fnanchor">[1417]</a> Hence the Swiss
theologians in his eyes were scarcely better than the authors
of the disgraceful abominations in Westphalia.</p>

<p>What sort of “concord” was to be expected while such
a temper held sway unless, indeed, the Zwinglians were
prepared to renounce their own existence and throw their
master overboard?</p>

<p>The prime movers in the attempt to bring about an
understanding between the Lutherans and the Swiss and
the like-minded Evangelicals of Upper Germany, were the
Landgrave Philip of Hesse, and the theologian Martin
Bucer.</p>

<p>Bucer, who was unremitting in his efforts to secure that
union which was his life-ideal, had already, at the Diet of
Augsburg, paved the way for an understanding, not without
some success. At the Coburg (September 25-26, 1530) he
managed to win over Luther to his view, viz. that an agreement
might be looked for with the Strasburgers regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
the Sacrament.<a name="FNanchor_1418_1418" id="FNanchor_1418_1418"></a><a href="#Footnote_1418_1418" class="fnanchor">[1418]</a> He then travelled through Upper Germany
and Switzerland with a plan for compromise, in which the
contradiction between the denial and assertion of the
Presence of Christ in the Sacrament was ably concealed;
Melanchthon he met at Cassel in 1534, and on this occasion,
ostensibly in the name of many South-German
theologians, made proposals which seem to have satisfied
Luther.</p>

<p>After further preliminaries, peace negotiations were to
have taken place at Eisleben in the spring of 1536, but as
Luther, owing to illness and new scruples, did not appear,
discussion was deferred till May 22, the delegates to meet
at Wittenberg. Thither representatives of Strasburg, Augsburg,
Memmingen, Ulm, Esslingen, Reutlingen, Frankfurt,
and Constance betook themselves, accompanied by the
Lutherans, Menius from Eisenach and Myconius from Gotha.
No Swiss delegate was present.</p>

<p>After protracted negotiations the South-German theologians
accepted a number of articles drawn up by Melanchthon
and known as the Wittenberg Concord.<a name="FNanchor_1419_1419" id="FNanchor_1419_1419"></a><a href="#Footnote_1419_1419" class="fnanchor">[1419]</a></p>

<p>In this they recognised the practice of infant baptism; as
regards Confession, they admitted that, though confession
as formerly practised could not be tolerated, yet a humble
private interview with the preacher, and private absolution
previous to the reception of communion, were useful and
wholesome. On the other hand, however, the main difference,
viz. that concerning the Presence of Christ in the
Sacrament, was only seemingly bridged over. It is true the
South-German delegates accepted the formula, that in
the Sacrament, the Body and Blood of the Lord are “really
and substantially” present by virtue of Christ’s words of
institution, so that even the “unworthy” verily receive the
Body and Blood of Christ. The interpretation which they,
headed by Bucer, placed upon the words showed, however,
quite plainly, that they did not agree with Luther, but still
clung to the view that Christ is not corporally present but
only by that faith, which even the “unworthy” may have,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
and that He does not bestow on the communicant His
Flesh and Blood, but merely His grace. “The Real
Presence of Christ was to him [Bucer] after all only a spiritual
presence.”<a name="FNanchor_1420_1420" id="FNanchor_1420_1420"></a><a href="#Footnote_1420_1420" class="fnanchor">[1420]</a> At any rate “the South-Germans, under stress
of political danger, rejoined Luther,”<a name="FNanchor_1421_1421" id="FNanchor_1421_1421"></a><a href="#Footnote_1421_1421" class="fnanchor">[1421]</a> though some of the
towns subsequently added conditions to their acceptance of
the arrangements made by their theologians.</p>

<p>Having been thus far successful Bucer, with consummate
ability and eloquence, proceeded to try to win over the
friendly Swiss Zwinglians to the Concord.</p>

<p>The Swiss were not, however, to be so easily induced to
take this step. In spite of several friendly letters from
Luther they could not arrive at the same apparent agreement
with him as the South-Germans. For this the blame
rested to some extent on Luther’s shoulders, his conduct
at this juncture, owing to political considerations, being
neither well-defined nor straightforward. The Burgomasters
and Councillors of the seven towns, Zürich, Bern, Basle,
Schaffhausen, St. Gall, Mühlhausen and Bienne, addressed
letters to him couched in conciliatory language, but Luther,
in spite of Bullinger’s request, would not even enumerate
in detail the points of difference which separated them from
him. For the nonce he preferred the policy of leaving
doctrine alone and of “calming down, smoothing and
furthering matters for the best,”<a name="FNanchor_1422_1422" id="FNanchor_1422_1422"></a><a href="#Footnote_1422_1422" class="fnanchor">[1422]</a> though all the time he
was well aware of their theological views and firm in his
repudiation of them.</p>

<p>“The matter refuses to suit itself to us, and we must
accordingly suit ourselves to it,”<a name="FNanchor_1423_1423" id="FNanchor_1423_1423"></a><a href="#Footnote_1423_1423" class="fnanchor">[1423]</a> such was, for a long while,
his motto. He is willing to hold out to the Zwinglians the
hand of friendship without, however, consenting to regard
the points in dispute as minor matters. Possibly he cherished
the hope that, little by little, agreement would be reached
even on these points.</p>

<p>Luther’s attitude has rightly been considered strange,
particularly when compared with his former severity. Even
Protestants have instanced it as remarkable, that he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
have contrived “to close his eyes to the differences which
still remained in spite of the Concord, and to agree with
people whose previous teaching he had regarded as dangerous
heresy, requiring to be expelled by a determined testimony
to the truth.”<a name="FNanchor_1424_1424" id="FNanchor_1424_1424"></a><a href="#Footnote_1424_1424" class="fnanchor">[1424]</a> At any rate “the broadness manifested
by Luther in this matter of faith” was something very
foreign to his usual habits.</p>

<p>The explanation of the change in his behaviour lies
chiefly in his urgent desire “to become terrible to the Pope
and the Emperor” by forming an alliance with the Swiss
Churches and townships, a hope which he even expressed
to his Wittenberg friends, adding, however, that “in men
one can never trust,” and, “I will not surrender God’s
Word.”<a name="FNanchor_1425_1425" id="FNanchor_1425_1425"></a><a href="#Footnote_1425_1425" class="fnanchor">[1425]</a> To Duke Albert of Prussia he wrote full of joy, in
May, 1538: “Things have been set going with the Swiss,
who hitherto have been at loggerheads with us on account
of the Sacrament.... I hope God will put an end to this
scandal, not for our sake, for we have deserved it, but for
His Name’s sake, and in order to vex the abomination at
Rome, for they are greatly affrighted and apprehensive at
the new tidings.”<a name="FNanchor_1426_1426" id="FNanchor_1426_1426"></a><a href="#Footnote_1426_1426" class="fnanchor">[1426]</a> Considerations of policy had entirely
altered Luther’s tone to the Zwinglians.</p>

<p>The bridge, however, collapsed before its completion.</p>

<p>The unrestrained language which Luther again employed
towards the Swiss did much to demonstrate how little real
foundation there was in the efforts at conciliation. The
experiences he met with made him regret his passing
opportunism, and in later life the tone in which he spoke
of the Zwinglian errors and their supporters was violent
in the extreme. When a letter reached him from the
Evangelicals of Venice bewailing the dissensions aroused
by the controversy on the Sacrament, he said in his reply,
dated June, 1543: These Zwinglians and their neighbours
“are intoxicated by an alien spirit, and their company must
be avoided as infectious.”<a name="FNanchor_1427_1427" id="FNanchor_1427_1427"></a><a href="#Footnote_1427_1427" class="fnanchor">[1427]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">To his friend Link he wrote about that time: “These Swiss
and Zürichers pronounce their own condemnation by their pride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
and madness, as Paul says” (Titus iii. 11).<a name="FNanchor_1428_1428" id="FNanchor_1428_1428"></a><a href="#Footnote_1428_1428" class="fnanchor">[1428]</a> To Zürich itself he
soon made no secret of his changed temper, writing in August
that: he could have no fellowship with the preachers there;
they were determined to lead the unfortunate people to hell;
the judgment of God which had overtaken Zwingli would also
fall upon these preachers of blasphemy, since they had made up
their minds to follow Zwingli.<a name="FNanchor_1429_1429" id="FNanchor_1429_1429"></a><a href="#Footnote_1429_1429" class="fnanchor">[1429]</a></p>

<p>In September of that same year appeared his energetic “Kurtz
Bekentnis Doctor Martin Luthers vom heiligen Sacrament.”<a name="FNanchor_1430_1430" id="FNanchor_1430_1430"></a><a href="#Footnote_1430_1430" class="fnanchor">[1430]</a></p>

<p>Complying with a need he felt he sought in this writing to give
public testimony to his faith in the Eucharist; in order at once
to disperse the ghosts of the Concord, and to bar the progress of
the denial of the Sacrament which had already infected Melanchthon
and other friends around him, he here speaks frankly and
openly. In his usual vein he says, that it was his wish “to be
able to boast at the Judgment Seat of the Lord” that “I condemned
with all my power the fanatics and enemies of the
Sacrament, Carlstadt, ‘Zwingel,’ [Œcolampadius, ‘Stinkfield’
[Schwenckfeld], and their disciples at Zürich and wherever else
they be.” The fanatics, he says, make a “great to-do” about a
spiritual eating and drinking, but they are “murderers of souls.”
They have a “devilish heart and lying lips.” Whoever believed
not the Article concerning Christ’s Presence in the Sacrament,
could not believe in the Incarnation. “Hence there is no
alternative, you must either believe everything or nothing.” Thus
Luther himself at last comes to urge against his opponents what
Catholic apologists had long before urged against him. They
had said: If you set aside this or that article of faith on the
grounds of a higher illumination, the result will be the complete
subversion of the faith, for the edifice of doctrine is one inseparable
whole; the divine and the ecclesiastical authority is
the same for all the articles, and, if everything be not accepted,
in the end nothing will remain.</p></div>


<h3>2. Efforts in view of a Council. Vergerio visits Luther</h3>

<p>Pope Clement VII. († 1534), though at first apprehensive,
owing to his knowledge of what had happened in the time of
the Reforming Councils, had nevertheless, towards the end
of his life, promised the Emperor Charles V. at Bologna, in
1533, that he would summon an [Œcumenical Council. He
had also sought to persuade the King of France, François I.,
on the occasion of their meeting at Marseilles in the same
year, to agree to the Council’s being held in one of the
Italian towns which Pope and Emperor had agreed on at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
Bologna.<a name="FNanchor_1431_1431" id="FNanchor_1431_1431"></a><a href="#Footnote_1431_1431" class="fnanchor">[1431]</a> But while Rome showed herself willing enough,
the King of France put great obstacles in the way of a
Council, in the hope, that, by preventing it, he would
prevent Germany from securing peace within her borders.</p>

<p>Paul III., the successor of Clement VII., was more successful,
though he too had to battle with his own scruples and
to overcome obstacles greater even than those which faced
his predecessor.</p>

<p>Soon after beginning his pontificate he dispatched three
Nuncios to pave the way for the Council, Rodolfo Pio de
Carpi to France, Giovanni Guidiccione to Spain, and Pierpaolo
Vergerio to Germany. The last of these found the
Catholic Courts perfectly willing to support the Council;
the heads of the Evangelical party, however, chose to
observe an attitude to be more fully described further on.</p>

<p>Charles V. having agreed to the choice of Mantua as the
town where the Council was to be held, Paul III., in spite
of the refusal of the Protestants, by his Bull of June 2,
1536, summoned the bishops to meet at Mantua on May 23
of the following year. Needless to say, the assembly and its
procedure were to be governed by the same rules as in the
case of earlier Councils of the Church.</p>

<p>The journey of Vergerio, the Nuncio, through Germany deserves
closer attention on account of his meeting with Luther.</p>

<p>The Papal envoy, who hailed from Capodistria and was
more skilful in Court transactions than in theology, commenced
his journey on February 10, 1535. From Vienna he
proceeded to visit the Bavarian Dukes and Suabia. He
then travelled along the Main and the Rhine as far north
as Liège, returning by way of Cologne through Saxony to
Brandenburg. Coming south from Berlin he passed a night
at Wittenberg, where he met Luther, and returned by way
of Dresden and Prague to Vienna. Everywhere he did his
best not only to secure consent to the Papal plan of holding
the Council in an Italian town, but also, as he had been
instructed, to combat the dangerous though popular
opposite plan of a German national Council. He could talk
well, had a sharp eye for business, and a fine gift of observation.
His expectations as regards the Protestants were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
however, far too rosy. The polite reception he met with
from the Protestant sovereigns and the honours done him
flattered his vanity, indeed, but were of little service to the
cause he represented.</p>

<p>What his intention was in going to Wittenberg and interviewing
Luther is not clear. He had no instructions to do
so. If he hoped to win over Luther to work for the Council
and for reunion, he was sadly deceived. In reality all he did
was to expose himself and his cause to insult and to furnish
his guest a welcome opportunity for boasting. In that same
year, in a work in which he held up the Council of
Constance to derision, Luther told the people how little
Councils were to be respected; by this Council the Church
had said to Christ: “You are a heretic and your teaching
is of the devil”; hence the Roman Church was possessed,
“not of seven, but of seven and seventy barrelfuls of
devils”;<a name="FNanchor_1432_1432" id="FNanchor_1432_1432"></a><a href="#Footnote_1432_1432" class="fnanchor">[1432]</a> now at last it was time for Christ to uncover
back and front the “raving, bloodthirsty scarlet woman
and reveal her shame to the whole world” in order to put an
end to “the insult which has been, and still is being, offered
to our dear Saviour by the dragon heads which peer out of
the back parts of the Pope-Ass and vomit forth abuse.”<a name="FNanchor_1433_1433" id="FNanchor_1433_1433"></a><a href="#Footnote_1433_1433" class="fnanchor">[1433]</a></p>

<p>From Vergerio’s circumstantial reports as Nuncio, and
from other sources,<a name="FNanchor_1434_1434" id="FNanchor_1434_1434"></a><a href="#Footnote_1434_1434" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a> we learn the details of the historic
meeting between the standard-bearer of the religious innovations
and the envoy of the head of Christendom.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">On his arrival at Wittenberg, on November 6, the Nuncio,
accompanied by twenty-one horsemen, proceeded to the Castle,
where he was to be the guest of Metzsch, the Commandant. He
sent an invitation by Metzsch to Luther to spend the evening
with him, but the latter refused to come so late and the visit
was accordingly arranged for the following morning. Luther
dressed himself in his best clothes, put on a gold chain, had
himself carefully shaved and his hair tidily brushed. To the
astonished barber he said jestingly, that he must appear young
in the eyes of the Legate so as to give him the impression that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
was still able to undertake and accomplish a great deal and thus
make them fear him at Rome; he was determined to read the
Roman gentry a good lesson; they had molested him and his
followers enough, now it was his turn to get his own back. As he sat
in the carriage with Bugenhagen the pastor of Wittenberg, ready
for the drive to the Castle, he said: “Here go the German Pope
and Cardinal Pomeranus, the chosen instruments of the Almighty.”</p>

<p>After being presented to the Legate, during which ceremony
he doffed his hat (the only sign of respect he was
willing to vouchsafe), he was invited to breakfast with him.
During the conversation which ensued he was at pains to show
his real feelings by a demeanour as hostile and threatening as
possible. “During the whole of the meal,” as he himself related
later to Justus Jonas,<a name="FNanchor_1435_1435" id="FNanchor_1435_1435"></a><a href="#Footnote_1435_1435" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a> “I played the true Luther; what sort of
things I said could not be put on paper.” At the first greeting he
at once asked the Nuncio ironically, whether he had not perchance
already heard him decried in Italy as a drunken German.</p>

<p>Pope Paul III. being mentioned by the Nuncio, Luther said,
that he might quite well be a prudent and honest man; such was
the common report concerning the Farnese when he (Luther)
was at Rome; but then, he added with a mocking smile, at that
time he himself was still in the habit of saying Mass.</p>

<p>Luther himself in the Table-Talk relates his reply to the
proposal to attend the Council: “I shall come,” he said, “but
you Papists are working and exerting yourselves in vain ...
for, when in Council, you never discuss wholesome doctrine, the
Sacraments, or the faith which alone makes us just and saves
us ... but only foolish puerilities, such as the long habits and
frocks which religious and priests are to wear, how wide the
girdle shall be and how large the tonsure,” etc. The account
goes on to say, that, at this sally, Vergerio, turning to his companion,
said: “Verily he has hit the nail on the head.” It is
difficult to believe that Vergerio actually made such a statement
in this connection.</p>

<p>Speaking of the [Œcumenical Council which had been summoned,
we read in Vergerio’s report that Luther with insufferable
arrogance exclaimed: “We stand in no need of a Council for
ourselves or our followers, for we already have the firm Evangelical
doctrine and rule; but Christendom needs the Council in
order to learn to distinguish truth and error, so far as it is still
held captive by false doctrine.” At this outburst the Nuncio
expressed his astonishment: “Yes, I will come to the Council,”
Luther interrupted him angrily, “I will forfeit my head rather
than fail to defend my teaching against the whole world. What
proceeds from my mouth, is not my own anger, but the wrath
of God!”&mdash;Whoever knows the man can scarcely doubt that
Luther would actually have gone to the Council under certain
conditions, particularly if furnished with a safe-conduct, though,
of course, only once again to “play the real Luther.” He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
certainly did not lack the audacity. He even declared himself
willing to agree to any of the places proposed for the Council,
whether Mantua, Verona, or Bologna; when it was pointed out
that Bologna belonged to the Pope, Luther, in the presence of the
Pope’s own representative, cried: “Good God, so the Pope
has grabbed that city too!” Curiously enough, in the report
he forwarded to Rome, the Nuncio declares himself satisfied
with Luther’s readiness to attend the Council.</p>

<p>Vergerio also led the conversation to Henry VIII., the King
of England; as Robert Barnes, an emissary of his, was then
staying with Luther at Wittenberg, he may have hoped to learn
something of the King’s intentions. Luther, however, was
extremely reticent. As he himself expressed it in a letter, he
acted the part of Barnes’s representative with “most vexatious
sayings,” i.e. with such as would most annoy and vex the Nuncio.
When mention was made of the cruel execution of Bishop
John Fisher&mdash;created Cardinal whilst awaiting his fate in
prison&mdash;Luther ejaculated that his death was a judgment from
on high because he had won the Cardinalate by withstanding
the Gospel.</p>

<p>Vergerio coming to speak of the Wittenberg hierarchy, Luther
admitted that, at Wittenberg, they ordained priests and that
Pastor Bugenhagen, who was then present, “was the bishop
appointed for that work; he ordained as St. Paul had taught”;
all in vain had the “most holy bishops” of the Papists refused
to ordain the Lutheran preachers. Alluding to his family, he
said he hoped to leave behind him in his firstborn a great
preacher, priest and teacher of the Evangel. The “reverend”
nun “whom he had married had so far presented him with three
boys and two girls.” Various religious practices came under
discussion and Vergerio, hoping to please, remarked, that he had
found much amongst the German Protestants different from
what he had been led to expect. He also spoke of fasting,
but Luther bluntly declared, that, just because the Pope had
commanded it, they would refuse to observe it; if, however, the
Emperor were to give the order, they would comply with it; he
himself would be right glad were the Emperor to set apart two
days in every week to be kept as strict fasts.</p>

<p>Though all this, which, moreover, the Nuncio took quite
seriously, made him angry, as is evident from his report, yet he
found leisure during the conversation to observe his guest closely.
He describes his dress: A doublet of dark camelot cloth, the
sleeves trimmed with satin; over this a rather short coat of
serge, edged with fox skin.<a name="FNanchor_1436_1436" id="FNanchor_1436_1436"></a><a href="#Footnote_1436_1436" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a> The large, rough buttons used struck
the Italian as peculiar. On Luther’s fingers he saw several rings
and round his neck the heavy gold chain. He found that Luther
did not speak Latin very well and ventured to surmise that
certain books, couched in better Latin, were probably not really
written by him. Of this, however, there is no proof. Luther
admitted to him that he was not used to speaking Latin and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
he was more at home in German. He looked strong, so Vergerio
says, and though past fifty did not appear to be even forty years
of age. He considered Luther’s features extremely coarse,
tallying with his manners, which displayed “presumption,
malice and want of reflection.” His way of speaking showed that
“everything he did was done in irritation, annoyance and out of
spite; he was a silly fellow, without either depth or discernment.”<a name="FNanchor_1437_1437" id="FNanchor_1437_1437"></a><a href="#Footnote_1437_1437" class="fnanchor">[1437]</a></p>

<p>Vergerio also fancied he saw in him something devilish. The
longer he observed the piercing, uncanny glance of Luther’s eyes,
so he writes, the more he was put in mind of certain persons who
were regarded by many as possessed; the heat, the restlessness,
the fury and frenzy expressed in his eyes were quite similar to
theirs.<a name="FNanchor_1438_1438" id="FNanchor_1438_1438"></a><a href="#Footnote_1438_1438" class="fnanchor">[1438]</a> He even casually refers to circumstances (which, however,
he does not describe) of Luther’s birth and earlier years,
which he had learnt from friends of Luther’s who had been
intimate with him before he became a monk; they confirmed
him in his belief that the devil had entered into Luther.<a name="FNanchor_1439_1439" id="FNanchor_1439_1439"></a><a href="#Footnote_1439_1439" class="fnanchor">[1439]</a> Although
Vergerio immediately after admits his doubt (“whether he be
possessed or not”), yet in what he had written Contarini discovered
sufficient to justify him in saying that Vergerio “found
that Martin was begotten of the devil.”<a name="FNanchor_1440_1440" id="FNanchor_1440_1440"></a><a href="#Footnote_1440_1440" class="fnanchor">[1440]</a> Contarini here is really
building on a stupid fable, which, as will be shown later (vol. iv.,
xxvii. 1), is first met with in the writings of Petrus Sylvius, a
Catholic author. What the Legate says concerning the circumstances
of Luther’s parents is not of a nature to excite any
confidence in the reliability of his information about Luther’s
youth. In Rome people were already perfectly acquainted with
Luther’s antecedents, as information had been obtained from
reliable witnesses even before his final excommunication. The
tittle-tattle of this new informant could accordingly have no
influence on the opinion concerning him already prevailing there.</p></div>

<p class="p1">After Vergerio the Nuncio had returned to Rome in the
beginning of 1536, full of extravagant hopes, he took part in
the drafting of the Bull already mentioned, summoning the
Council to meet at Mantua in 1537. In the same year he
was consecrated bishop. He was not, however, employed
in diplomacy as frequently as he wished. In 1541 unfavourable
reports began to circulate concerning his attitude
towards the Church; he was charged with Protestant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
leanings, though some of the witnesses in the trial which he
had to stand at Venice protested his entire innocence. At
any rate, towards the close of 1548 he openly apostatised
and fled to the Grisons, where he placed his services at
the disposal of the Swiss Reformers. His desire to distinguish
himself next caused him to abandon the Swiss
Zwinglians and to settle at Tübingen. After many journeys,
undertaken with the object of thwarting the Church of Rome,
this pushful and unrestrained man died at Tübingen in
1565, still at enmity with Catholicism.<a name="FNanchor_1441_1441" id="FNanchor_1441_1441"></a><a href="#Footnote_1441_1441" class="fnanchor">[1441]</a></p>


<h3>3. The Schmalkalden Assembly of 1537. Luther’s Illness</h3>

<p>The Schmalkalden League, established in 1531 (see above,
p. 64 ff.), was in the main directed against the Emperor and
the Empire. It had grown stronger by the accession of
other Princes and States who bound themselves to render
mutual assistance in the interests of the innovations. In
the very year Vergerio started on his mission of peace
in December, 1535, the warlike alliance, headed by Hesse
and the Saxon Electorate, had been renewed at Schmalkalden
for ten years. It undertook to raise 10,000 foot
soldiers and 2000 horse for the defence of the Evangel, and,
in case of need, to double the number.</p>

<p>To oppose this a more united and better organised league
of the Catholics was imperatively called for; the alliance
already entered into by some of the Princes who remained
true to the older Church, required to be strengthened and
enlarged. In 1538 the new leaguers met at Nuremberg; at
their head were Charles V. and Ferdinand the German King,
while amongst the most prominent members were the Dukes
Wilhelm and Ludwig of Bavaria and the Archbishops of
Mayence and Salzburg, whose secular principalities were
very considerable.</p>

<p>Arming of troops, threats of war, and petty broils aroused
apprehension again and again, but, on the whole, peace was
maintained till Luther’s death.</p>

<p>The protesting Estates were desirous of deciding, at a
convention to be held at Schmalkalden on Candlemas Day,
1537, upon the attitude to be assumed towards the Council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
convened by the Pope to Mantua. Hence, on August 30,
1536, Johann Frederick, Elector of Saxony, instructed
Luther to draw up a preliminary writing; he was to state
on Scriptural grounds what he felt it his duty to advance
concerning all the Articles of his teaching as though he were
in the presence of a Council or before the Judgment-Seat
of God, and also to point out those Articles regarding which
some concessions might be made “without injury to God
or His Word.”</p>

<p>Luther therefore set to work on his “Artickel so da hetten
sollen auffs Concilion zu Mantua,” etc., duly printed in 1538,
with some slight alterations.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Here, whilst expounding theologically the various Lutheran
doctrines, he gives his opinion on the Pope; this opinion is all
the more remarkable because incorporated in a document
intended to be entirely dispassionate and to furnish the Council
with a clear statement of the new faith. The Pope, so Luther
declares, is “merely bishop or parish-priest of the churches of
Rome”; the universal spiritual authority he had arrogated
to himself was “nothing but devilish fable and invention”; he
roared like the dragon in the Apocalypse, who led the whole
world astray (Apoc. xii. 9); he told people: “All you do is done
in vain unless you take me for your God.” “This point plainly
proves that he is the real Endchrist and Antichrist, who sets
himself up against and above Christ, because he will not allow
Christians to be saved without his authority.... This even the
Turks and ‘Tatters’ do not dare to attempt, great enemies of
Christians though they be.” “Hence, as little as we can adore the
devil himself, as Lord and God, so little can we suffer his apostle,
the Pope, or Endchrist, to rule as our Head and Lord. For his
real work is lying and murder, and the eternal destruction of
body and soul, as I have proved at length in many books.”<a name="FNanchor_1442_1442" id="FNanchor_1442_1442"></a><a href="#Footnote_1442_1442" class="fnanchor">[1442]</a></p>

<p>Luther concludes this memorable theological essay (at least in
the printed version) with an application to the projected Council:
“If those who obey the Evangel attend it, our party will be
standing before the Pope and the devil himself.” At the Diet of
Augsburg they stood before the Empire, “before the Emperor
and secular authorities,” who had been gracious enough to give
the cause a hearing; now, however, we must say to the Pope, as
in the book of Zacharias [iii. 2] the angel said to the devil: ‘May
God rebuke thee, Satan.’<a name="FNanchor_1443_1443" id="FNanchor_1443_1443"></a><a href="#Footnote_1443_1443" class="fnanchor">[1443]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">When engaged on this work, and whilst the Schmalkalden
meeting was in progress, Luther appears to have been the
prey of a perfect paroxysm of fury. Hate, as a positive
mental disorder, then attained in him an acute crisis. Later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
on, his anger abated for a while, as though exhausted, until,
just before his death, the spirit of the storm broke out
afresh with hurricane violence in his “Wider das Bapstum
zu Rom vom Teuffel gestifft.”</p>

<p>At the time he wrote his work in preparation for the
Schmalkalden meeting he was already ailing. His nervous
system was strained beyond all limit. Hence we can
more readily understand the passion which seems to possess
him against that Church of Rome, which, instead of collapsing,
as he had fondly hoped she would, was daily growing
stronger in spite of all her losses.</p>

<p>The “Artickel,” which were submitted to Johann
Frederick the Elector, on January 6, 1537, were signed
likewise by Jonas, Bugenhagen, Cruciger, and Melanchthon.
Melanchthon, however, because the abuse of the Pope did
not meet with his approval and was scarcely to be squared
with his previous temporising assurances, added that, he,
for his part, was ready, “in the interests of peace and the
common unity of those Christians who are now subject to
him and may be so in the future,” to admit the Pope’s
supremacy over the bishops; but the Pope was to hold his
office only by “human right” and “in as far as he was
willing to admit the Evangel.” Johann Frederick was
sufficiently clear-sighted to see through this proposal&mdash;so
typical of Melanchthon&mdash;and to recognise in it a vain
attempt to square the circle. He expressed his disapproval
of the addition, pointing out that any recognition of the
Papacy would involve a return to the old bondage. The
Pope “and his successors would leave no stone unturned to
destroy and root out us and our successors.”</p>

<p>The opinion of the Elector prevailed in the Council of
the Princes and among the preachers assembled at Schmalkalden.</p>

<p>For all their exasperation against the Pope, Luther, and
the Wittenberg theologians, were not averse to taking part
in the Council. Luther, for instance, opined, that they
ought not to give the Papists an excuse for saying they had
made impossible the holding of a Council.<a name="FNanchor_1444_1444" id="FNanchor_1444_1444"></a><a href="#Footnote_1444_1444" class="fnanchor">[1444]</a> In a memorandum
of December 6, 1536, the theologians, with Luther
and Amsdorf, advised that the Council should be promoted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
so as to render possible a protest. The proposal of the
Elector to hold an opposition Council they rejected, urging
that such a Council would “look terribly like establishing a
schism”; moreover, the lack of agreement among themselves
would permit of no such thing, for they would be exposing
themselves to the contempt of their opponents, and holding
back foreign countries from joining the Evangel. On the
other hand, it was the duty of the authorities to offer resistance
in the interests of their subjects and Divine worship,
should the Council prove unjust; open violence and
notorious injustice were to be met by violence.<a name="FNanchor_1445_1445" id="FNanchor_1445_1445"></a><a href="#Footnote_1445_1445" class="fnanchor">[1445]</a> In this
memorandum Melanchthon’s influence is clear enough in the
apprehension of any appearance of setting up a “schism.”
Luther signed it with the words: “I, Martin Luther, will
do my best by prayer, and if needs be, with the fist.”<a name="FNanchor_1446_1446" id="FNanchor_1446_1446"></a><a href="#Footnote_1446_1446" class="fnanchor">[1446]</a> The
Schmalkalden delegates, however, as we shall see below,
strode rough-shod over this memorandum and declined to
have anything to do with the Council.</p>

<p>On January 31, 1537, Luther, with Melanchthon and
Bugenhagen, set out for Schmalkalden where a Papal envoy,
the Bishop of Acqui, was also expected. On the journey he
said in the presence of several gentlemen of the Nuncio’s
retinue: “So the devil is sending the Papal emissary as his
ambassador to Schmalkalden to see if, perchance, he can
destroy God’s work.” Besides the secular delegates, some
forty Protestant theologians had gathered at Schmalkalden,
and Melanchthon was in the greatest apprehension lest
quarrels should break out amongst them.<a name="FNanchor_1447_1447" id="FNanchor_1447_1447"></a><a href="#Footnote_1447_1447" class="fnanchor">[1447]</a> His fears were
not altogether groundless, for it was not long before the
usual want of unanimity became apparent amongst the
Lutheran preachers. The “Artickel,” drawn up by Luther,
aroused dissension. They were not equally acceptable to
all, some, for instance, taking offence at his teaching on the
Supper, so that a controversy on this point between such
men as Amsdorf and Osiander on the one side and Blaurer
on the other, was to be feared. Melanchthon, however, was
more cautious and avoided insisting on his own divergent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
view regarding the Eucharist. He and Cruciger were
sternly charged by Cordatus, the minister, with not preaching
aright Luther’s doctrine of Justification by Faith, and
the charge was supported also by Amsdorf. Osiander, the
Nuremberg theologian, finally set against a sermon of
Luther’s on the divine sonship conferred on the Christian
by faith in Christ (1 John iv. 1 ff.), a sermon of his own,
embodying quite other views.</p>

<p>Luther could think of no better plan than to lay before the
Elector his fears lest internal strife should prove the undoing
of his whole enterprise, and to implore him, as father
of the country, to take some steps to prevent this.</p>

<p>Owing to the disunion rife among the preachers, Luther’s
“Artickel” were never officially discussed by the delegates.
This was primarily Melanchthon’s doing; by means of an
intrigue which he started at the very outset of the Conference,
and thanks to the assistance of the Landgrave of
Hesse, he had caused it to be settled behind Luther’s
back, that no explicit acceptance of Luther’s exposition of
faith was called for, seeing that the Estates had already
taken their stand on the basis of the Augsburg Confession
and the Wittenberg Concord. “The device was characteristic
enough of Melanchthon, but his procedure as a whole
can scarcely be acquitted of insincerity.” (Ellinger.)</p>

<p>Melanchthon was now entrusted with the preparation of
a fresh work on the Papal Primacy, to be described more
fully later.<a name="FNanchor_1448_1448" id="FNanchor_1448_1448"></a><a href="#Footnote_1448_1448" class="fnanchor">[1448]</a> Although it far exceeds in malice any other
work of Melanchthon’s, or perhaps for that very reason, it
was accepted by the Princes and the theologians.</p>

<p>The truth is, that, in their hostility to Popery all were at
one. Opposition to the Church was the bond which united
them.</p>

<p class="p2">Meanwhile, whilst at Schmalkalden, Luther had been
visited by a severe attack of stone, an old trouble which
now seemed to put his life in danger. During this illness
his hatred of the Pope broke out afresh, yet, later, he felt
justified in boasting of the moderation he had displayed
during the convention, because, forsooth, of his advice
regarding attendance at the Council. He prides himself on
the consideration which at Schmalkalden he had shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
the Papists: “Had I died there, it would probably have
been the ruin of the Papists, for only after I am dead will
they see what a friend they have had in me; for other
preachers will prove incapable of the same moderation and
‘<i>epieikeia</i>.’”<a name="FNanchor_1449_1449" id="FNanchor_1449_1449"></a><a href="#Footnote_1449_1449" class="fnanchor">[1449]</a></p>

<p>Luther’s illness increased to such an extent that fears
were entertained for his life. He himself thought seriously
of death, though never for an instant did he think of reconciliation.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">His prayer, as he related later, was as follows: “O God, Thou
knowest that I have taught Thy Word faithfully and zealously....
O Lord Jesus Christ, how grand a thing is it for a man to die
by the sword for Thy Word.... I die as an enemy of Thine
enemies, I die under the ban of the Pope, but he dies under
Thy ban.... I die in hatred of the Pope (‘<i>ego morior in odio
papæ</i>’).”<a name="FNanchor_1450_1450" id="FNanchor_1450_1450"></a><a href="#Footnote_1450_1450" class="fnanchor">[1450]</a> “Thou, Lord Christ,” he said, “take vengeance
upon Thine enemy; I have done well in tearing the Pope to
pieces.” On February 25, when racked with pain, he said to
Herr von Ponikau, one of the Elector’s chamberlains: “I have
to be stoned like Stephen, and the Pope will rejoice. But I hope
he will not laugh long; my epitaph shall be verified: ‘In life,
O Pope, I was thy plague, in dying I shall be thy death (‘<i>Pestis
eram vivus, moriens ero mors tua, Papa</i>’).’”<a name="FNanchor_1451_1451" id="FNanchor_1451_1451"></a><a href="#Footnote_1451_1451" class="fnanchor">[1451]</a></p>

<p>On February 26 the sick man was brought away from Schmalkalden
in a carriage, the intention being to convey him to Wittenberg.
Luther was anxious not to rejoice the Papists by breathing
his last in a locality where the Bishop of Acqui, the Papal envoy, was
stopping. “At least not in the presence of the monster, the Pope’s
ambassador,” as he said. “I would die willingly enough were
not the devil’s Legate at Schmalkalden, for he would cry aloud
to the whole world that I had died of fright.” This he said before
his departure.<a name="FNanchor_1452_1452" id="FNanchor_1452_1452"></a><a href="#Footnote_1452_1452" class="fnanchor">[1452]</a> Seated in the carriage as the horses were being
got ready, he received the greetings of those present and made
the sign of the cross over them, saying: “May the Lord fill you
with His blessing and with hatred of the Pope.”<a name="FNanchor_1453_1453" id="FNanchor_1453_1453"></a><a href="#Footnote_1453_1453" class="fnanchor">[1453]</a> Mathesius, his
pupil, adds in his 11th Sermon on Luther: “Then and there, in
the carriage, he made his last will and testament, willing and
bequeathing to his friends the preachers, ‘<i>odium in papam</i>,’ viz.
that they should not allow themselves to be deceived by the
Pope’s doctrine but remain constant to the end in their hostility
to his idolatry.”<a name="FNanchor_1454_1454" id="FNanchor_1454_1454"></a><a href="#Footnote_1454_1454" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a> According to Ericeus he also said on leaving:
“Take heed to this when I am dead: If the Pope lays aside his
crown, renounces his throne and primacy, and admits that he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
erred and destroyed the Church, then and only then will we
receive him into our communion, otherwise he will always
remain in our eyes the real Antichrist.”<a name="FNanchor_1455_1455" id="FNanchor_1455_1455"></a><a href="#Footnote_1455_1455" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">After Luther’s departure the assembly considered the
question of the Council. Any share in it was refused point-blank.
Even the letters on the subject which the Legate
had brought with him were returned unopened. In the
final resolution the proposed [Œcumenical Council&mdash;although
it was to be held in complete accordance with ancient
ecclesiastical rules&mdash;was described as a partisan, unreliable
and unlawful assembly because it would consist exclusively
of bishops, would be presided over by the Pope and would
not be free to decide according to the Word of God.</p>

<p>In its outspoken rejection of the Council the Conference
was more logical than Luther and his theological counsellors.
The warlike company brushed aside all the considerations
of prudence and policy alleged by the more timid theologians.</p>

<p>They further declared, that they would maintain the
Wittenberg Concord of 1536; it was also stated in the
resolutions that their theologians were agreed upon all the
points of the Augsburg Confession and “<i>Apologia</i>”; one
article only, viz. that concerning the authority of the Pope,
had they altered; in other words, they had accepted the
recently drafted document of Melanchthon’s, which, however,
repudiated the Papacy far more firmly than the
Augsburg Confession had done. (See below, p. 439.)</p>

<p>Luther, though absent, had every reason to be satisfied
with what had been achieved.</p>

<p>Luther’s condition had meanwhile improved, and he had
already returned to Wittenberg. On the very first day of
his journey he had felt some relief, and on the following day
he wrote to Melanchthon to inform him of it, crowning the
joyful tidings with his blessing:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“May God preserve you all and cast down Satan under your
feet with all his crew, viz. the monsters of the Roman Curia.”<a name="FNanchor_1456_1456" id="FNanchor_1456_1456"></a><a href="#Footnote_1456_1456" class="fnanchor">[1456]</a></p>

<p>On his arrival at Gotha, the journey having proved toilsome
and exhausting, and the malady again threatening to grow worse,
he made his so-called “First Will.” It commences with the
words: “I know, God be praised, that I have done rightly in
storming the Papacy with the Word of God, for Popery spells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
blasphemy against God, Christ and the Gospel.” In his name
they were to tell the Elector, our sovereign, and also the Landgrave,
that “they were not to allow themselves to be disturbed
at the howls of their opponents, who charged them with stealing
the possessions of the Church; they do not rob like some others
do; indeed, I see [such at least was his <i>hope</i>] how, with these
goods, they provide for the welfare of religion. If a little of it
falls to their share, who has a better right to it than they? Such
possessions belong to the Princes rather than to the rascally
Papists. Both sovereigns were to do confidently on behalf of
the Evangel whatever the Holy Ghost inspired them to do....
If they are not pure in all things, but in some respects sinners,
as our foes allege, yet they must trust in God’s mercy.... I am
now ready to die if the Lord so will, but I should like to live at
least till Whitsun, in order, before all the world, to write against
the Roman beast and its Kingdom with a heavier fist.... If
I recover I intend to do far worse than ever before. And now I
commend my soul into the hands of the Father and my Lord
Jesus Christ, Whom I have preached and confessed upon earth.”<a name="FNanchor_1457_1457" id="FNanchor_1457_1457"></a><a href="#Footnote_1457_1457" class="fnanchor">[1457]</a></p>

<p>His friends related that at Gotha he made his confession, and
received “absolution” from Bugenhagen. After his state of
health had greatly improved he was able to continue his journey
to Wittenberg, where he arrived safely. Thence, a week later, he
was able to announce to Spalatin the progress of his “convalescence,
by God’s grace,” commending himself likewise to his
prayers.<a name="FNanchor_1458_1458" id="FNanchor_1458_1458"></a><a href="#Footnote_1458_1458" class="fnanchor">[1458]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">His anger against the Pope, to which hitherto he had not
been able to give free rein, he now utilised to stimulate and
refresh his exhausted bodily and mental powers. He once
said, that, to write, pray or preach well, he had first to be
angry. In Mathesius we find Luther’s own description of the
effects of his anger: “Then my blood is refreshed, my mind
becomes keen and all my temptations vanish.”<a name="FNanchor_1459_1459" id="FNanchor_1459_1459"></a><a href="#Footnote_1459_1459" class="fnanchor">[1459]</a></p>

<p>Here we must revert once more to his maledictory prayer
against the Pope and the Papists, and to certain other of his
sayings.<a name="FNanchor_1460_1460" id="FNanchor_1460_1460"></a><a href="#Footnote_1460_1460" class="fnanchor">[1460]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“If I am so cold at heart that I cannot pray,” so he said on one
occasion to Cordatus, “I call to mind the impiety and ingratitude
of my foes, the Pope and King Ferdinand, in order to inflame my
heart with righteous hate, so that I can say: Hallowed be Thy
Name, etc., and then my prayer glows with fervour.”<a name="FNanchor_1461_1461" id="FNanchor_1461_1461"></a><a href="#Footnote_1461_1461" class="fnanchor">[1461]</a> As given
in the German edition of the Table-Talk, his words are briefer,
but none the less striking: “I conjure up the godlessness of the
Pope with all his ulcers and parasites, and soon I grow warm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
burn with anger and hate.”<a name="FNanchor_1462_1462" id="FNanchor_1462_1462"></a><a href="#Footnote_1462_1462" class="fnanchor">[1462]</a> As already related, in his maledictory
Paternoster, he accompanies the petitions of the Lord’s
Prayer with a commentary of curses.<a name="FNanchor_1463_1463" id="FNanchor_1463_1463"></a><a href="#Footnote_1463_1463" class="fnanchor">[1463]</a> He would fain see others
too, “cursing the Papacy with the Our Father, that it may
catch St. Vitus’s Dance.”<a name="FNanchor_1464_1464" id="FNanchor_1464_1464"></a><a href="#Footnote_1464_1464" class="fnanchor">[1464]</a> Concerning his Paternoster he
assures us, “I say this prayer daily with my lips, and in my
heart without intermission.” And yet he does not shrink from
adding: “Nevertheless I preserve a friendly, peaceable and
Christian spirit towards everyone; this even my greatest
enemies know.”<a name="FNanchor_1465_1465" id="FNanchor_1465_1465"></a><a href="#Footnote_1465_1465" class="fnanchor">[1465]</a></p>

<p>In 1538, the year after his serious illness, an amended edition
of his “Unterricht der Visitatorn an die Pharhern” was issued
by him. Although he exhorts the pastors to “refrain from
abusive language” in the pulpit, yet he expressly tells them to
“damn the Papacy and its followers with all earnestness as
already damned by God, like the devil and his kingdom.”<a name="FNanchor_1466_1466" id="FNanchor_1466_1466"></a><a href="#Footnote_1466_1466" class="fnanchor">[1466]</a></p>

<p>Luther’s character presents many psychological problems
which seem to involve the observer in inextricable difficulty;
certain phenomena of his inner life can scarcely be judged by
common standards. The idea of the devil incarnate in Popery
distorts his judgment, commits him to statements of the maddest
kind, and infects even his moral conduct. It is not easy to say
how far he remained a free agent in this matter, or whether the
quondam Catholic, priest and monk never felt the prick of conscience,
yet such questions obtrude themselves at every step.
For the present we shall merely say that his freedom, and consequently
his actual responsibility, were greater at the time he
first gave such ideas a footing in his mind, than when he had
fallen completely under their spell.<a name="FNanchor_1467_1467" id="FNanchor_1467_1467"></a><a href="#Footnote_1467_1467" class="fnanchor">[1467]</a></p></div>

<h4>4. Luther’s Spirit in Melanchthon</h4>

<p>During the spring of 1537, when Luther was at Schmalkalden
writhing under bodily anguish and the influence of
his paroxysm of hate, a notable change took place in
Melanchthon’s attitude towards the older Church. The
earlier spiritual crisis, if we may speak of such a thing,
ended in his case in an almost inexplicable embitterment
against the Church of his birth.</p>

<p>A proof of this is more particularly to be found in the
document then drawn up by Melanchthon, “On the power
and primacy of the Pope.”<a name="FNanchor_1468_1468" id="FNanchor_1468_1468"></a><a href="#Footnote_1468_1468" class="fnanchor">[1468]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>But a short time before he had looked upon the declaration
against the Pope, drafted by Luther for the Schmalkalden
Conference, as too strong. Yet, after having, as
related above,<a name="FNanchor_1469_1469" id="FNanchor_1469_1469"></a><a href="#Footnote_1469_1469" class="fnanchor">[1469]</a> all unknown to Luther, contrived to prevent
any discussion of the latter’s so-called “Artickel,” and
having, at the request of the Princes and Estates, set to
work on a statement concerning the Primacy and the
Episcopate, he himself came gradually, perhaps without
noticing it, under the influence of the passion of anti-popery
which found expression at this Assembly.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">In Melanchthon’s Schmalkalden writing “On the Power and
Primacy,” we read, that “the Popes defend godless rites and
idolatry”; they had introduced horrible darkness into the
Church. “The marks of Antichrist agree with the empire of the
Pope,” as is plain from Paul.<a name="FNanchor_1470_1470" id="FNanchor_1470_1470"></a><a href="#Footnote_1470_1470" class="fnanchor">[1470]</a> “The Pope arrogates to himself
the right to alter the doctrine of Christ.... He even claims
rights over the souls of the departed.” “He makes himself God,”
for he recognises no authority above him. “These errors he
vindicates with the utmost cruelty ... slaying all who differ
from him.” All the faithful must therefore “curse” him and
regard his teaching as “devils’ doctrine.”</p>

<p>After this profession of pure doctrine comes the chapter on
abuses.<a name="FNanchor_1471_1471" id="FNanchor_1471_1471"></a><a href="#Footnote_1471_1471" class="fnanchor">[1471]</a> “The profanation of Masses,” amongst the Papists,
“is idolatry”; the “most revolting money-making” is carried
on by this means. “They teach that sin is forgiven on account
of the value of our works and then require each one to be ever
in doubt as to whether his sins have really been forgiven.
Nowhere do they clearly say that it is on account of the merits of
Christ that sins are forgiven gratuitously. On the other hand,
they do away with true worship, viz. the exercise of that faith
which wrestles with despair.”<a name="FNanchor_1472_1472" id="FNanchor_1472_1472"></a><a href="#Footnote_1472_1472" class="fnanchor">[1472]</a> “Vows they have stamped as
righteousness before God, declaring that they merit the forgiveness
of sins.” It is the duty of the Christian Princes to intervene;
they must see that “errors are removed and consciences healed.”
They “must not assist in strengthening idolatry and other
infamies, or in slaughtering the Saints.” They, beyond all others,
“must place a check on the licentiousness of the Popes,” the
more so “since the Pope has bound the bishops under terrible
curses to support his tyranny and his godless behaviour.”</p>

<p>A shorter memorandum of Melanchthon’s, appended to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
above, referred to the “Power and jurisdiction of the Bishops.”<a name="FNanchor_1473_1473" id="FNanchor_1473_1473"></a><a href="#Footnote_1473_1473" class="fnanchor">[1473]</a>
This in the clearest and most decided fashion marks the breakdown
of all the author’s earlier seeming concessions concerning
the retention of the episcopate. “Since the bishops,” he says
towards the close, “in their dependence on the Pope defend his
godless doctrine and godless worship ... second the Pope’s
cruelty and tyrannically abuse the jurisdiction they have
wrenched from the clergy ... the churches must not acknowledge
them as bishops.”</p>

<p>At the end there is a hint at the wealth of the bishops, doubtless
not unwelcome to the Princes: “The bishops can no longer
hold their lands and revenues with a good conscience” because
they do not make use of them for the good of souls; their possessions
ought rather to be employed “for the Church,” “to
provide for the preachers [ministers], to support students and
the poor, and in particular to assist the law-courts, especially
the matrimonial courts.” Here we have his sanction to the
Church’s spoliation.</p></div>

<p class="p1">We may be certain that Melanchthon never came to use
such language, so similar to Luther’s, concerning the Papal
Antichrist, idolatry and murder, solely as the result of
pressure on the part of the Princes, who had been enraged
by the invitation to attend the Council, and were determined
to crush once and for all every hope of conciliation. We may
take it that his new frame of mind was partly due to Luther’s
serious illness. Luther believed that his end was nigh, he
adjured the Princes and his friends manfully to tackle
Antichrist, and he cursed the dissensions that had broken
out amongst his theologians, and promised soon to ruin his
life’s work. This made a great impression on Melanchthon.
As a matter of fact the relations between him and Luther,
subsequent to the latter’s recovery, became closer than
they had been for years.</p>

<p>The change in Melanchthon at Schmalkalden was immortalised
by his frightful document on the Pope and the
Bishops being subscribed to by thirty-two of the theologians
and preachers there present.<a name="FNanchor_1474_1474" id="FNanchor_1474_1474"></a><a href="#Footnote_1474_1474" class="fnanchor">[1474]</a> When, at a later date, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
formulæ of Concord were drawn up, it was included amongst
the “symbolical books” of Lutheranism.<a name="FNanchor_1475_1475" id="FNanchor_1475_1475"></a><a href="#Footnote_1475_1475" class="fnanchor">[1475]</a> As such, along
with the others, it appears down to the present day, even in
the latest edition (1907), at the head of which is printed the
traditional motto of the whole series: “One Lord, one
faith, one Baptism” (Eph. iv. 5).</p>

<p>At the Schmalkalden Conference, Melanchthon, in spite
of what he had written concerning the Pope, declared himself,
like Luther, in favour of accepting with due reserves
the invitation to the Council, as otherwise they would be
rendering their position more difficult and would make the
whole world think that they had rudely refused the olive-branch.
The rejection of his proposal annoyed him, as also
did the discourteous treatment&mdash;described by Melanchthon
as “very vulgar”&mdash;which the Papal Legate endured at the
hands of the Elector Johann Frederick. His fit of indignation
does not, however, seem to have lasted long, as he did
not refuse the invitation to draw up a statement, addressed
in the name of the Assembly to all Christian Princes, in
which the Council was repudiated in the strongest terms.
The refusal to take any part in it, so it declares, was rendered
imperative by the clear intention of the Pope to suppress
heresy.<a name="FNanchor_1476_1476" id="FNanchor_1476_1476"></a><a href="#Footnote_1476_1476" class="fnanchor">[1476]</a></p>

<p>His hostility and his irritation against, the Papacy repeatedly
found expression in after years.</p>

<p>It was quite in Luther’s style, when, in a little work which
appeared at Wittenberg in 1539, he called the Pope, with
his bishops and defenders, “the tyrants and persecutors of
Christ,” who “are not the Church; neither are those who
support them or approve such acts of violence.”<a name="FNanchor_1477_1477" id="FNanchor_1477_1477"></a><a href="#Footnote_1477_1477" class="fnanchor">[1477]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Before the War of Schmalkalden he republished several times
Luther’s inflammatory pamphlet, “Warnunge an seine lieben
Deudschen,” of 1531 (see vol. ii., p. 391), in order to move public
opinion against the Empire. To these new editions of the
booklet against the Popish “bloodhounds”<a name="FNanchor_1478_1478" id="FNanchor_1478_1478"></a><a href="#Footnote_1478_1478" class="fnanchor">[1478]</a>&mdash;one of the most
violent the author ever wrote&mdash;Melanchthon added a preface
in which he shows himself “animated and carried away by
Luther’s words.”<a name="FNanchor_1479_1479" id="FNanchor_1479_1479"></a><a href="#Footnote_1479_1479" class="fnanchor">[1479]</a> In reading it we feel the warmth of the fiery
spirit which glows in Luther’s writings, for instance, when he
classes his opponents with the “cut-throats of the streets,”
whom “to resist was a work well-pleasing to God.”<a name="FNanchor_1480_1480" id="FNanchor_1480_1480"></a><a href="#Footnote_1480_1480" class="fnanchor">[1480]</a> The Pope,
according to him, is anxious “to re-establish his idolatry and his
errors by dint of bloodshed, murder, everlasting devastation of
the German nation and the destruction of the Electoral and
Princely houses.” Thus “Spaniards and Italians, and perhaps
even possibly the Turks,” will break into the German cities. “The
devils rage and cause all manner of desolation.” Our enemies
are “knowingly persecutors of the truth and murderers of the
Saints.” Whoever is about to die let him consider, that the
death of the righteous is more pleasing to God than “the life
of Cain and the luxury and power of all the bishops and
cardinals.”</p>

<p>Hence it was but natural that violent measures of defence
should appear to Melanchthon both called-for and meritorious.</p>

<p>As a just measure of defence and resistance he regarded his
own suggestion made to the Elector of Saxony through his
Chancellor on the occasion of the Protestantising of the town
of Halle, the residence of Albert of Brandenburg, viz. that
Albert’s whole diocese of Halle and Magdeburg should be taken
possession of by the Elector. Owing to Luther’s dissuasion this
act of violence, which would have had momentous consequences,
was, however, prevented. Melanchthon’s advice was, that they
“should, as opportunity arose, seize the bishoprics, in order that
the priests might be emboldened to abstain from knavish
practices, to co-operate in bringing about a lasting peace, and to
leave the Word of God unmolested for the future.”<a name="FNanchor_1481_1481" id="FNanchor_1481_1481"></a><a href="#Footnote_1481_1481" class="fnanchor">[1481]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">In this way Melanchthon more than once gave the lie to
those who extol his kindliness. Luther once said, that,
whereas he stabbed with a hog-spear, Philip preferred to
use goads and needles, though his little punctures turned
out more painful and difficult to heal; the “little man”
(Melanchthon was of small stature) was pious, and, even
when he did wrong, meant no ill; he sinned because he was
too lenient and allowed himself to be taken in; but this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
sort of thing was of little use; he, on the other hand,
thought it best to speak out to the knaves; for clods a
pick-axe was very useful; Philip allowed himself to be
devoured, but he, on the contrary, devoured everything
and spared no one.<a name="FNanchor_1482_1482" id="FNanchor_1482_1482"></a><a href="#Footnote_1482_1482" class="fnanchor">[1482]</a></p>

<p>In his controversial writings and memoranda, written in
well-turned and polished language, Melanchthon went on as
before to accuse the Catholic theologians and the Popes of
holding doctrines and opinions, of which, as Döllinger
rightly said, “no theologian had ever thought, but the
opposite of which all had taught.”<a name="FNanchor_1483_1483" id="FNanchor_1483_1483"></a><a href="#Footnote_1483_1483" class="fnanchor">[1483]</a></p>

<p>He refused to recognise what was good and just in the
long-looked-for proposals for the amelioration of the Church
which the Papal commission submitted to Paul III. in 1537.
They were made known at Wittenberg through their publication
by Johann Sturm of Strasburg.</p>

<p>Luther at once took the field against them with his
favourite weapons, the “pick-axe” and the “hog-spear.”<a name="FNanchor_1484_1484" id="FNanchor_1484_1484"></a><a href="#Footnote_1484_1484" class="fnanchor">[1484]</a>
Melanchthon mentions them, but has “not a word to say in
favour of the important reforms they proposed.... The
fact, however, that one of Erasmus’s writings was therein
characterised as harmful, incensed him against Sadolet
[one of the Cardinals whose signatures were appended].”
“With good reason, and, from the schoolmaster’s point of
view, quite justly,”<a name="FNanchor_1485_1485" id="FNanchor_1485_1485"></a><a href="#Footnote_1485_1485" class="fnanchor">[1485]</a> they say of the “<i>Colloquia familiaria</i>”
of Erasmus, that “this book should be forbidden in the
schools,” as it might do harm to young minds.<a name="FNanchor_1486_1486" id="FNanchor_1486_1486"></a><a href="#Footnote_1486_1486" class="fnanchor">[1486]</a> This greatly
displeased Melanchthon, himself a writer on pedagogy;<a name="FNanchor_1487_1487" id="FNanchor_1487_1487"></a><a href="#Footnote_1487_1487" class="fnanchor">[1487]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
and yet the “<i>Colloquia</i>” in question are so permeated with
indecent elements that they have been rightly instanced to
prove how lax were the views then prevalent in Humanistic
circles.<a name="FNanchor_1488_1488" id="FNanchor_1488_1488"></a><a href="#Footnote_1488_1488" class="fnanchor">[1488]</a> Luther himself strongly disapproved of the
“<i>Colloquia</i>” of Erasmus, declaring it a godless book, and
forbidding his children to read it; therein the author put
his own antichristian ideas in the mouths of others.<a name="FNanchor_1489_1489" id="FNanchor_1489_1489"></a><a href="#Footnote_1489_1489" class="fnanchor">[1489]</a>
“Erasmus, the scoundrel,” he says, gives vent to his
contempt for religion “more particularly in his ‘<i>Colloquia</i>.’”<a name="FNanchor_1490_1490" id="FNanchor_1490_1490"></a><a href="#Footnote_1490_1490" class="fnanchor">[1490]</a>
“He is an incarnate scamp, as is shown by his books,
notably by the ‘<i>Colloquia</i>.’”<a name="FNanchor_1491_1491" id="FNanchor_1491_1491"></a><a href="#Footnote_1491_1491" class="fnanchor">[1491]</a></p>

<p>In the Antinomian controversy at home, between Johann
Agricola and Luther, it was Melanchthon who sought by
means of adroit formulæ and memoranda to achieve
the impossible, viz. to square Agricola’s views with Luther’s
teaching at that time. In reality Melanchthon was merely
working for the success of his own milder version of Luther’s
view of the law, to which moreover the latter had already
given his assent. To Agricola, Melanchthon wrote feelingly:
“In all that Luther does there is a certain Achillean
violence, of which you are not the only victim.”<a name="FNanchor_1492_1492" id="FNanchor_1492_1492"></a><a href="#Footnote_1492_1492" class="fnanchor">[1492]</a></p>

<p>On the outbreak of the Osiander controversy on Confession,
the ever-ready Melanchthon again set to work,
endeavouring to pour oil on the troubled waters. He
assured Osiander that “were I able to bind down with chains
of adamant the tempers of all the clergy, I should assuredly
make this the goal of my most earnest endeavour.”<a name="FNanchor_1493_1493" id="FNanchor_1493_1493"></a><a href="#Footnote_1493_1493" class="fnanchor">[1493]</a></p>

<p>Melanchthon’s 1540 edition of the Augsburg Confession,
the so-called “<i>Confessio variata</i>,” was a good sample of his
elasticity and power of adaptation in the domain of dogma.
The “<i>Variata</i>” caused, however, quite a commotion amongst
the representatives of the innovations.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">In the “<i>Confessio Variata</i>” Melanchthon, in order to curry
favour with the Swiss and the adherents of the <i>Tetrapolitana</i>,
with whom his party was politically leagued, set aside the
“semblance of Transubstantiation” contained in the Article
concerning the Supper (Art. x.) and struck out the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
“<i>quod corpus et sanguis Christi vere adsint</i>,” as well as the
rejection of the contrary belief. For these was substituted:
“Together with the bread and wine in the Supper the communicants
are shown [’<i>exhibeantur</i>’ instead of the former
‘<i>adsint et distribuantur</i>’] the Body and Blood of Christ.” This
was practically to abandon the Real Presence. “Neither the
doctrine of Bucer [who was a Zwinglian] on the Supper, nor that
of Calvin, is excluded.”<a name="FNanchor_1494_1494" id="FNanchor_1494_1494"></a><a href="#Footnote_1494_1494" class="fnanchor">[1494]</a></p>

<p>At a later date, in 1575, Nicholas Selnecker, a Leipzig professor,
whilst actual witnesses were yet living, declared that he had
been informed by officials of high standing that the alterations
concerning the Supper in the “<i>Variata</i>” were due to Philip of
Hesse’s epistolary representations to Melanchthon. The former
had held out the hope that he, and also the Swiss, would accept
the Confession should his suggestion be accepted.<a name="FNanchor_1495_1495" id="FNanchor_1495_1495"></a><a href="#Footnote_1495_1495" class="fnanchor">[1495]</a> We may
call to mind that about that same time, i.e. about December,
1539, the Landgrave was desirous of yet another concession in
his favour, viz. of sanction for his bigamy, and that Bucer, who
had been sent by him to Wittenberg, threw out the hint that,
were permission refused, the Prince would forsake the Evangelical
cause.</p>

<p>Melanchthon also obliterated in the “<i>Variata</i>” several other
“traces of a too diplomatic attempt to conciliate the Romanists....
Melanchthon’s clearer perception of the doctrine of
Justification also made some alteration necessary.” The Article
“<i>De iustificatione</i>” (Art. iv.) was accordingly revised, and
likewise the Article “<i>De bonis operibus</i>” (Art. xx.), that both
might correspond with the doctrine already embodied in the
1535 edition of the “<i>Loci</i>.” In Article iv. the brief “<i>hanc
fidem imputat Deus pro iustitia</i>” was removed and replaced by:
“<i>homines iustos pronuntiari, id est reconciliari</i>,” by the imputation
of righteousness, this being explained at considerable length.
A new interpretation was also given to the doctrine of good
works, i.e. by the thesis, that obedience to the law is necessary
on the part of the justified.<a name="FNanchor_1496_1496" id="FNanchor_1496_1496"></a><a href="#Footnote_1496_1496" class="fnanchor">[1496]</a> In conversion, the necessity of
contrition, and that not merely passive, previous to Justification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
by faith is asserted, the Divine Will that all men be saved is
openly advocated, that God is the author of sin is more strongly
denied than before.<a name="FNanchor_1497_1497" id="FNanchor_1497_1497"></a><a href="#Footnote_1497_1497" class="fnanchor">[1497]</a></p>

<p>In spite of all these alterations, which, more particularly that
concerning the Supper, might have wounded Luther’s susceptibilities,
“Melanchthon was never reproved on account of the
‘<i>Variata</i>’ either by Luther or by others [of the sect]; what we
hear to the contrary is nothing but an invention of the anti-Philippians.
The truth is that the ‘<i>Variata</i>’ was generally
accepted without question and made use of officially, for instance,
at the religious conferences.”<a name="FNanchor_1498_1498" id="FNanchor_1498_1498"></a><a href="#Footnote_1498_1498" class="fnanchor">[1498]</a> In January, 1541, the Augsburg
Confession was to be made the basis of the first religious conference
at Worms. When Melanchthon appealed to the “<i>Variata</i>,”
Eck drew particular attention to the difference between the new
and the old version. Melanchthon, however, insisted on the
identity of their contents and would only admit that, in the
“<i>Variata</i>,” he had toned down and chosen his expressions more
carefully.<a name="FNanchor_1499_1499" id="FNanchor_1499_1499"></a><a href="#Footnote_1499_1499" class="fnanchor">[1499]</a> As Eck, in order to come to the point, desisted from
any further objections, the diversity was passed over. The
conference, owing to other causes, was a failure, and so was
the next, held at Ratisbon in April of the same year, which was
fruitless owing to Melanchthon’s own conduct. Calvin, who was
present, wrote on May 12 of the practices of the Protestant
leaders: “Melanchthon and Bucer drew up equivocating and
ambiguous formulæ on Transubstantiation, seeking to hoodwink
their adversaries. They were not afraid to deal in equivocal
phrases though there is nothing more mischievous.”<a name="FNanchor_1500_1500" id="FNanchor_1500_1500"></a><a href="#Footnote_1500_1500" class="fnanchor">[1500]</a></p>

<p>In connection with the eventual fate of the “<i>Variata</i>” we
may here refer to the deep animosity which the more zealous
Lutherans, with Flacius Illyricus at their head, displayed towards
Melanchthon on account of the alterations in the Augsburg
Confession. So serious did the rupture become that the dissension
between the Protestant theologians actually rendered
impossible any public negotiations with the Catholics. This
fact proves how little Melanchthon, the then leader of the
Protestants, had been successful in welding together with
“chains of adamant” the theologians of his party.</p>

<p>The standpoint of the amended Confession of 1540, however,
enlisted all Bucer’s sympathies on Melanchthon’s behalf.</p></div>

<p class="p1">With Bucer’s smooth ways Melanchthon had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
found himself in harmony during the negotiations in view
of the Wittenberg Concord. Mentally the two had much
in common. Melanchthon had worked with Bucer at Bonn
in 1543, making use of every kind of theological artifice
and enlisting the service of those who were in revolt against
the moral laws of the Church, in order to bring about the
apostasy of Cologne, though their efforts were fruitless.
Want of success here was, however, not due to any half-measures
on Melanchthon’s part, for the latter repeatedly
spoke against any toleration being shown to the ancient
“errors.” In his reply to Eberhard Billick he attacked,
for instance, the “idolatry” which prevailed in the Rhineland,
witnessed to by the invocation of Saints, the veneration
of images, the Sacrifice of the Mass, and the Processions of
the Sacrament.<a name="FNanchor_1501_1501" id="FNanchor_1501_1501"></a><a href="#Footnote_1501_1501" class="fnanchor">[1501]</a></p>

<p>By this attack on the citadel of Catholicism in the Rhine
Province he again reaped a harvest of trouble and anxiety,
in consequence of his and Bucer’s differences with Luther
on the doctrine of the Supper.</p>

<p>In the text of the “Cologne Book of Reform,” composed
by both, Luther failed to find expressed his doctrine of the
Presence of Christ, but rather the opposite. For this reason
an outbreak on his part was to be feared, and Melanchthon
trembled with anxiety, since, as he says in one of his letters,<a name="FNanchor_1502_1502" id="FNanchor_1502_1502"></a><a href="#Footnote_1502_1502" class="fnanchor">[1502]</a>
Luther had already begun to “stir up strife” in his
sermons. He fully expected to have to go into exile. It
was said that Luther was preparing a profession of faith
which all his followers would have to sign. But, this time
again, Melanchthon was spared, though Bucer was not so
fortunate; in Luther’s furious writing against the deniers
of the Sacrament, the latter was pilloried, but not Melanchthon.<a name="FNanchor_1503_1503" id="FNanchor_1503_1503"></a><a href="#Footnote_1503_1503" class="fnanchor">[1503]</a>
Outwardly Luther and Melanchthon remained
friends. In the Swiss camp they were well aware of the
difficulties of the scholar who refused to place himself
blindly under the spell of Luther’s opinions. Bullinger,
Zwingli’s successor at Zürich, invited him to come there and
promised to see that the magistrates provided him with a
suitable stipend. Calvin declared later, in 1560, that
Melanchthon had several times told him sorrowfully, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
he would much rather live in Geneva than in Wittenberg.<a name="FNanchor_1504_1504" id="FNanchor_1504_1504"></a><a href="#Footnote_1504_1504" class="fnanchor">[1504]</a>
Concerning Melanchthon’s views on the Eucharist, Calvin
said: “I can assure you a hundred times over, that to
make out Philip to be at variance with me on this doctrine
is like tearing him away from his own self.”<a name="FNanchor_1505_1505" id="FNanchor_1505_1505"></a><a href="#Footnote_1505_1505" class="fnanchor">[1505]</a> This explains
why Melanchthon always sought to evade the theological
question as to how Christ is present in the Sacrament.</p>

<p>One of the last important works he carried out with
Luther was the so-called “Wittenberg Reformation,” a
writing drawn up at the Elector’s request. The document,
which was presented by Luther and the Wittenberg
theologians on January 14, 1545, was intended, in view of
the anticipated Diet, to express theologically the position
of the Reformers with regard to a “Christian Settlement.”
Here Melanchthon found himself in his own element. In
this work he distinguished himself, particularly by his
cleverly contrived attempts to make out the new doctrine
to be that of the old and real Church Catholic, by his stern
aversion to Popish “idolatry” and by his repudiation of anything
that might be regarded as a concession, also by the
unfeasible proposal he made out of mockery, that the
bishops, in order to make it possible for the Protestants to
join their congregations, should “begin by introducing the
pure evangelical doctrine and Christian distribution of the
Sacraments,” in which case Protestants would obey them.<a name="FNanchor_1506_1506" id="FNanchor_1506_1506"></a><a href="#Footnote_1506_1506" class="fnanchor">[1506]</a></p>

<p>The Wittenbergers, in other words, offered to recognise
the episcopate under the old condition, upon which they
were ever harping, though well aware that it was impossible

<p>They thus showed plainly how much store was to be set
on the tolerance of certain externals promised by the
wily Melanchthon. In this document he “retained certain
outward forms to which the people were accustomed,
proposing, however, to render them innocuous by imbuing
them with a new spirit, and to use them as means of religious
and moral education in the interests of the Evangelical
cause. It was in the same sense that he was ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
recognise the episcopate.”<a name="FNanchor_1508_1508" id="FNanchor_1508_1508"></a><a href="#Footnote_1508_1508" class="fnanchor">[1508]</a> In reality it was the merest irony
to demand, that all the bishops of Christendom should
prepare the way for and welcome the innovations. Such
was, however, the spirit and tone of Melanchthon’s “very
mild reform,” as Brück the Chancellor described it to the
Elector. Luther, however, in order as it were to furnish
a commentary on its real sense, at that very time put his
pen to his last and most revolting work against the Papacy.<a name="FNanchor_1509_1509" id="FNanchor_1509_1509"></a><a href="#Footnote_1509_1509" class="fnanchor">[1509]</a></p>

According to Maurenbrecher, “Studien und Skizzen zur Gesch. der
Reformationszeit,” p. 235, Luther “fell back from the position he had
assumed from 1519 to the beginning of 1521 owing to the subjective,
and also objective, impossibility [of proceeding in so radical a way as
previously.]” H. Lang, a Protestant, whose “M. Luther, ein religiöses
Charakterbild,” 1870, he quotes, goes still further, and ascribes to
Luther the entire abandonment of his own principles; he is also of
opinion that Luther does not disguise the fact that [in the Anabaptist
business] he would have considered all in order had the reforms been
carried out by himself. “That he was vexed to see others reap where
he had sown, is only human nature,” says Lang; thus he “sided with
the reactionaries,” though he had really taught what the fanatics
were putting in practice; from that time forward he advocated a
“mediæval ecclesiasticism,” deprived the Congregations of the management
of the reform, which they had set about so vigorously, and transferred
it to the rulers. Such a view is widely held among Protestant
historians to-day.</p>

“Luther im Lichte der neueren Forschung,” 1906, p. 127 (omitted
in the 2nd edition). In 1524 Luther, when engaged with Münzer, still
held that “all should preach stoutly and freely as they were able and
against whomsoever they pleased.... Let the spirits fall upon one
another and fight it out. Should some be led astray, so much the
worse.” True doctrine being the fittest would nevertheless survive
and prevail. To the Elector Frederick and Duke Johann of Saxony,
July, 1524, “Werke,” Erl. ed., 53, p. 265 (“Briefwechsel,” 4, p. 372).
The contradiction involved in the freedom which Luther apparently
concedes to him was pointed out by Münzer in his “Schutzrede,”
Fol. C. III., “Briefwechsel,” 4, p. 375. Hence when Luther counselled
that the revolt should be put down by force of arms, those who considered
the war unjust, for instance because they happened to hold
Anabaptist views, could well appeal to Luther and refuse to lend their
assistance. (See present work, vol. ii., p. 311 f.)</p>

Though it might be urged that he subordinates the first too much
to the second even in his earlier period. In the “Kurcz Form der
czehen Gepott,” etc. (1520), “Werke,” Weim. ed., 7, p. 215; Erl. ed.,
22, p. 15, he teaches: “that there are two ways of believing: First,
concerning God, when I believe what is said of God to be true, just
as I believe that to be true which is said of the Turks, of the devil,
or of hell; this faith is more a sort of knowledge, or observation, than
real faith. According to the other we believe <i>in</i> God (<i>Credo in Deum</i>),
i.e. when I not only believe that to be true which is said of God, but
place my trust in Him.... It is only such a faith which hazards all
on God ... which makes a Christian.... This is a living faith ...
and this none can give but God alone.” The Catholic Church, however,
had always required a “living faith,” one working by charity (<i>fides
caritate formata</i>). It is remarkable how much, in the above passage,
Luther allows the formal principle of historical faith, viz. the authority
of the Revealing God, to recede into the background.</p>

entire reversion to mediæval fashions of thought. It is shown that

that Bishops and Prelates remain quiescent, do not resist, care but

Turks whom the King, the Princes and the Nobles ought to attack
first,” just as a father of a family who has gone out of his mind “must
be placed under restraint and controlled.... The best and only thing
to do was, for the King, Princes, Nobles, townships and parishes to
put their hands to the business and make an end of it themselves, so

In strange contrast, to the last passage quoted, he goes on to
inculcate the most respectful obedience to the secular authorities:
“Even though they do what is wrong, still God wills that they should
be obeyed without subterfuge or danger” (p. 259=198). They have
“nothing to do with the preaching and the faith.” “They must not
be resisted even though they do what is unjust” (<i>ibid.</i>). “There are
many abuses prevalent amongst the secular authorities,” etc. (p. 260=199).
He is accordingly very anxious for their improvement.</p>

“Troubled consciences” alone would appreciate the consolation
in his chief doctrine, viz. that of Justification, for which reason Melanchthon
in the apology of the Augsburg Confession (“Symbol. Bücher<sup>10</sup>,”
pp. 87, 90, 118, 120, 174) is fond of representing Justification by faith
alone under the aspect of a solace and consolation amidst the terrors of
conscience caused by the consciousness of sin. Whoever had not experienced
such fears could have no real understanding of Justification.
Such a view of Justification, K. Holl, a Protestant theologian, remarks
had its value while it was still a question of winning over Catholics to
the new teaching, since, according to Luther, the Catholic trust in
works necessarily led to “despair.” But, in the new generation, who
had grown up as Lutherans, “consciences were already comforted
before ever they experienced any terrors”; nor did Luther make it
at all plain how often, i.e. whether “once only or more frequently,”
it was necessary to experience the consoling power of the Gospel
amidst terrors of conscience in order to arrive at the full assurance of
Justification. “Die Rechtfertigungslehre im Lichte der Gesch. des
Protestantismus,” 1906, p. 14.</p>

We have indicated in the above our own position with respect to
two opposing views recently put forward concerning the development
of the early Lutheran Church, viz. P. Drews, “Entsprach das Staatskirchentum
dem Ideale Luthers?” (see above, p. 24, n. 4), and H.
Hermelink, “Zu Luthers Gedanken über Idealgemeinden und von
weltlicher Obrigkeit,” in “Zeitschr. für KG.,” 29, 1908, p. 267 ff.,
with epilogue on Drews. See also vol. v., xxx., 2, on State and State
Church according to Luther’s views and complaints. While Drews
emphasises the “congregations of true believers” as “Luther’s ideal”
(p. 103), Hermelink lays stress on the fact that Luther always believed
that in the last instance the Christian authorities would be forced to
introduce and see to the uniformity of worship in their lands. The
disagreement on so vital an historical question only emphasises anew
the want of consistency in Luther and the contradictions contained
in his statements. See vol. ii., p. 112, n. 1. Cp. p. 294 ff., and the
quotation (from W. Hans): “The contradictions in the theory
[Luther’s] and between his theory and practice can never be explained.”</p>

An earlier explanation of Luther’s as to the way in which he
understood destruction only shows that then, in 1522, he was averse
to the carrying out of such a project: “This destruction and annihilation
I would not have understood as meaning the use of violence and
the sword. For they are not worthy of such chastisement nor would
anything be gained by it&mdash;but as Daniel viii. teaches: Antichrist
shall be destroyed without hands, when everyone teaches, speaks and
holds God’s Word against him.... This is a true Christian destruction.”
“Werke,” Weim. ed., 10, 2, p. 140; Erl. ed., 28, p. 178.
Even H. Preuss recognises in his “Die Vorstellungen vom Antichrist,”
p. 115, that, in Luther’s replies to Alveld and in his epitome of Silvester
Prierias, “there smoulders such anger as shows that recourse to arms
was imminent.” Cp. passages from Luther’s writings referred to in
vol. ii., p. 190, n. 3.</p>

In the “Tischreden” of Mathesius (p. 80), Luther says: “We
shall never be successful against them [the Turks] unless we fall upon
them and the priests at the right moment and smite them dead.”
The editor remarks: “By this he can only mean the priests in general,
not those only of the two small bishoprics.” See vol. ii., p. 324. Cp.

The tract is printed by Hortleder, “Von den Ursachen des deutschen
Krieges,” 2, Gotha, 1645, p. 39 ff., and the passage in question
(p. 50) runs: “D. Pommer and Melanchthon have repudiated D.
Martin’s counsels to the Elector Johann ... in a public writing,
and not only declare that they are not D. Martin’s but have condemned
them as false, and contrary to the plain truth of God’s Word.” P.
Wappler, “Inquisition und Ketzerprozesse in Zwickau zur Reformationszeit,”
Leipzig, 1908, p. 134, says: “Naturally the repudiation
of this memorandum of Luther’s of March, 1530, on the part of theologians
of the standing of Melanchthon and Bugenhagen, who had
actually sanctioned it themselves, was not of a nature to enhance the
reputations of those theologians amongst such as had read Luther’s early
writings on the behaviour to be observed towards the secular authority.”

Johann von Sachsen vom 6. März 1530,” in “Theol. Studien und
Kritiken,” 1909, p. 471 ff.</p>

<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 148=79. It is impossible to concur in the unconditional
praise usually bestowed upon Luther by Protestants on account of his
attitude in the midst of the Turkish peril. It was even said that he gave
expression in powerful language, and without any thought of personal
interest, to what God required “of every Christian and every German”
in this emergency. Nor is it correct to state “that the contradiction
with his later views was merely apparent” when he expressed
himself at first as against the campaign. How real the contradiction
is can be seen not only from the above and from what follows, but
also from his later recommendations based on religious motives in
favour of the war. Thus he says in the “Vermanunge zum Gebet
wider den Türcken” of the year 1541 (see vol. v., xxxiv. 2): “We are
fighting to preserve God’s Word and His Church,” etc. (“Werke,”

favourite expression “We Germans,” we may here remark that
Luther’s opponents at Leipzig spread the report that he was really of
Bohemian origin. This they did when, in his Sermon on the Body of
Christ, preached in 1519, he had demanded the general use of the
chalice at communion, as did the Utraquists of Bohemia. As to this
statement that “I was born in Bohemia, educated at Prague and
instructed in Wiclif’s writings,” Luther replied in his writing: “Erklerung
etlicher Artickel yn seynem Sermon von dem heyligen Sacrament,”
1520, that this was a “piece of folly.” “Werke,” Weim. ed.,

Doctor Johann Mensing, O.P., a literary opponent of Luther’s, in
dedicating a polemical tract of 1526, defends the Catholics’ sense of
patriotism, speaking of Luther as the “destroyer of our fair German
land” (see “Luthers Werke,” Weim. ed., 8, p. 478). Another Dominican,
Thomas Rhadinus Todischus, in 1520, in the title of a work published
at Rome, describes him as “violating the glory of the nation” (“<i>nationis
gloriam violans</i>”). The latter work was attributed by Luther and
Melanchthon to Emser, who, however, repudiated the authorship.

230 ff. Michael rightly quotes the following striking passage of the
earlier Döllinger as descriptive of the attitude of the Church towards
Luther: “May not the time come, nay, be already at hand, when
[Protestant] preachers and theologians will take a calmer view of
things and realise that the Catholic Church in Germany only did what
she could not avoid doing? All the reproaches and charges made
against this Church amount in fine to this, that she rejected the
demand made of her in the name of the Reformation to break with
her past, that she remained faithful to her traditions, that she persisted
in developing along the lines originally laid down, and resolved to
fulfil her task while holding fast to the uninterrupted continuity of her
ecclesiastical life and her connection with the other portions of the
Church” (“Kirche und Kirchen,” p. 490).</p>

In the same way that he here abuses the Emperor, so he also
knows how to bestow praise upon him; for instance, in the official
writing referred to above (p. 89) to the Electoral Prince Joachim of
Brandenburg and in his “Warnunge an seine lieben Deudschen,”
where he declares, strangely enough, that “our beloved Emperor
Carol” has shown himself hitherto, and last of all at the Diet of
Augsburg in 1530, such, that he has won the respect and love of the
whole world and deserves that no trouble should befall him, and that
our people should only speak in praise of his Imperial virtue (“Werke,”
Weim. ed., 30, 3, p. 291; Erl. ed., 25², p. 23), and yet, even there, in
consequence of his edict against the new faith at the Diet of Augsburg,
he puts the Emperor with the Pope, as the originators of a resolution
which “must prove an eternal blot upon all the Princes and the whole
Empire, and make us Germans blush for shame before God and the
whole world,” so that “even the Turk, the ‘Tattars’ and ‘Moscobites’
despise us.” “Who under the whole expanse of heaven will for the
future fear us or think well of us when they hear that we allow ourselves
to be hoaxed, mocked, treated as children, as fools, nay, even
as clods and blocks by the cursed Pope and his tools [who hold the
Emperor in leading strings]?... Every German may well regret
that he was born a German and is called a German” (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 285=15).
On the strength of the words quoted above in praise of the Emperor
we find Luther credited in Protestant works of history with “the old,
loyal sentiments of a good, simple German for his Emperor,” nay,
even with “the language of charity which according to Holy Scripture
believes all things, hopes all things.” And yet Luther in his letters to
his confidential friends spoke after this of Charles V. in the following
terms: “The Emperor was, is, and shall ever remain a servant of the
servants of the devil,” and the worst of it is, that he “lends the devil
his services knowingly” (to Jonas, etc., March or April, 1540, “Briefe,”
ed. De Wette, 5, p. 275). “God’s wrath has come upon him and his
friends.... We have prayed enough for him, if he does not want a
blessing, then let him take our curse.” He accuses him of hypocrisy
(“<i>purus hypocrita</i>”) and of breach of faith with the Turks after his stay
at Vienna; he had swallowed up the Bishopric of Liège and intended
to do the same with all the bishoprics along the Rhine (to Melanchthon,
June 17, 1541, “Briefe,” 5, p. 370). “I suspect the Emperor is a
miscreant (‘<i>quod sit nequam</i>’) and his brother Ferdinand is an abominable
bounder” (to Amsdorf, October 21, 1545, “Briefe,” 5, p. 764).</p>

It will not be possible to enter one by one into the somewhat
remarkable reasons assigned in the popular Protestant biographies of
Luther as to why Luther should be regarded as the type of the German
character. We there read, that the stamp of the German character is
to be found in the fact that he “always acted upon impulse”&mdash;which
seems to be based on the correct view of Luther as a child of impulse,
who allowed himself to be carried away by his feelings. The following
reason is less clear, viz. that he was “A German through and through
because he sought for the roots of all life, of the family, the race, the
State and civilisation, in personality as directly determined by feeling.”
Reference is frequently made to Luther’s frank and upright character
and to his undaunted love of truth. The facts bearing upon this point,
already adduced, or to be dealt with in chapter xxii. of the present
work (vol. iv.), dispense us from treating of this matter here. To base
Luther’s claim to being a typical German on his manner of speech is to
run the risk of bringing Germans into disrepute, if we recall the rude
invective in which he often indulges and which he employs when, as he
says, he is speaking plain German to his opponents. “This is the
German way of speaking,” he constantly repeats after explosions of
anger and vulgar abuse. This, for instance, is the way in which he
gives the “Romans a German answer.” On one occasion he describes
in a repulsive manner how the “strumpet church of the Pope” behaves:
“She plays the whore with everyone,” is an “apostate, runaway,
wedded whore, a house-whore, a bed-whore”; compared with her
“light women are holy, for she is the devil’s own whore,” who makes
of many of the faithful virgins of Christ, born in baptism, arch-whores.
“This is what I call plain German speaking, and you and everyone can
understand what I mean.” On the same page he continues: “It
has happened to them [the Papists] according to the proverb: the dog
has returned to his vomit and the sow that was washed to wallow in
the mire. That is what you are, and what I once was. There you have
your new, apostate, runaway churches described for you in plain
German.” “Werke,” Erl. ed., 26² p. 46. “Wider Hans Worst,” 1541.</p>

How little this view of Luther fits in with his own estimate of
himself may be seen from the following statements which occur in his
Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians (1531, vol. i., in Irmischer’s
ed.): Heretics, owing to a delusion of Satan, consider their doctrines
as absolutely certain; founders of sects, more particularly, will never
allow themselves to be converted by our proofs from Scripture, as we
see in the case of the fanatics; so well does the devil know how to
assume the shape of Christ. “I, however, am persuaded by the Spirit
of Christ, that my doctrine of Christian righteousness is true and certain
(<i>sum certus et persuasus per spiritum Christi</i>, p. 288); therefore I
cannot listen to anything to the contrary.” Hence “the Pope, the
Cardinals, bishops, and monks and the whole synagogue of Satan,
and in particular the founders of the Religious Orders (some of whom,
nevertheless, God was able to save by a miracle), confuse men’s consciences
and are worse than false apostles” (p. 83). Like St. Paul
he pronounces anathema on all angels and men who rise up to destroy
the Gospel preached by Paul; of such subverters the world is now,
alas, full (p. 89). By the fanatics, he says (p. 90), he too was accounted
such a one, though he only paid homage to pure Scripture as to his
“Queen” (p. 93). “Like Paul I declare with the utmost certainty
every doctrine to be anathema which differs from my own.... Its
founder is the messenger of Satan, and is anathema.” “<i>Sic nos cum
Paulo securissime et certissime pronuntiamus, omnem doctrinam esse
maledictam, quæ cum nostra dissonat.... Qui igitur aliud evangelium
vel contrarium nostro docet, missum a diabolo et anathema esse confidenter
dicimus</i>” (p. 94).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Just as in Paul’s day the Galatians had become inconstant, so
“some, who at the outset had accepted the Word with joy and among
whom were many excellent men, had now suddenly fallen away,”
because the Lord had withdrawn His Grace (p. 99). They bring
forward as objections against us the belief of the Church and of
antiquity. But “should Peter and Paul themselves, or an angel from
heaven, teach differently, yet I know for a certainty that my teaching
is not human but Divine, i.e. that I ascribe all to God and nothing to
man” (p. 102). “It is true that this very argument prejudices our
cause to-day more than anything else. If we are to believe only him
who teaches the pure Word of God, not the Pope, or the Fathers, or
Luther, whom then are we to believe? Who is to reassure man’s
conscience as to where the true Word of God is preached, whether
amongst us or amongst our opponents? For the latter also boast of
having and teaching the true Word of God. We do not believe the
Papists because they do not and cannot teach the Word of God.
They, on the other hand, declare us to be the greatest heretics. What
then is to be done? Is every fanatic to be permitted to teach whatever
comes into his head, while the world refuses to hear us or to endure our
teaching?” In spite of our assurances of the certainty of our teaching,
he complains, they call our boasting devilish; if we yield, then they,
the Papists and the fanatics, grow proud and become still more
settled in their error. “Therefore let each one see that he is convinced
of the truth of his own calling and doctrine, so that, like Paul, he may
venture to say with absolute certainty and conviction: ‘If an angel
from heaven,’ etc.” The revelation of the Gospel is made to each one
individually, and is “effected by God Himself, yet the outward Word
must precede and then the inward Spirit will follow.... The Holy
Ghost is given for the revealing of the Word, but the outward Word
must first have been heard” (p. 114).</p>
<p class="pfc4">In opposition to the fanatics Luther is fond of tracing back his own
great illumination, which had brought salvation to the world, to the
preliminary action, of the outward Word of Holy Scripture on his mind.
Towards the end of his life he wrote (on May 7, 1545) to Amsdorf:
“I glory in the certainty that the Son of God is seated at the right
hand of the Father and most sweetly speaks to us here below by His
Spirit even as He spoke to the Apostles, and that therefore we are His
disciples, and hear the Word from His lips.... We hear the Divine
Majesty speaking through the word of the Gospel. The angels and the
whole creation of God congratulate us on this, while the Pope, that
monster of the devil, wobbles in sadness and fear and all the gates of
hell tremble with him” (“Briefe,” 5, p. 737). At an earlier date, in
1522, he had declared: “This is what you must say: Whether Luther
is a saint or a scamp does not matter to me; his doctrine is not his,
but Christ’s ... leave the man out of the question, but acknowledge
the doctrine” (“Von beider Gestallt des Sacramentes,” “Werke,”
Weim. ed., 10, 2, p. 40). “I don’t care in the very least whether a
thousand Augustines or a thousand Harry-Churches are against me,
but I am convinced that the true Church clings to the Word of God as
I do” (“Werke,” Weim. ed., 10, 2, p. 256; Erl. ed., 28, p. 379. “Against
King Henry VIII.”) “I was he to whom God first revealed it”
(“Werke,” Weim. ed., 10, 3, p. 8).</p>
<p class="pfc4">J. A. Möhler rightly remarks: “Seeing that it was Luther’s design
to break with the existing, visible Church, it was essential that he
should give the first place to the invisible Church and look on himself as
directly sent by God.” He points out that Calvin also appealed to
a direct mission, and quotes from his answer to Sadolet’s letter to the
inhabitants of Geneva: “<i>ministerium meum, quod Dei vocatione
fundatum ac sanctum fuisse non dubito</i>”; “<i>ministerium meum, quod
quidem a Christo esse novi</i>.” “Opusc.,” pp. 106, 107 (“Symbolik,”
49, n 1).</p>

“Werke,” Weim. ed., 6, p. 477; Erl. ed., 24², p. 16 (in 1520).
Here again we find the “she-ass that rebuked the prophet.” This
enables us to understand his asseveration in the same year (“Werke,”
Weim. ed., 7, p. 277; Erl. ed., 27, p. 213), that he was ready to die for
his doctrine. Döllinger says of such assurances as the above: “Such
a tone of unshaken firmness was in Luther’s case largely due to the
excitement caused by his polemics ... and to the sense of his natural
superiority” (“Luther, eine Skizze,” p. 53; also “Kirchenlexikon,”
8², col. 340). He points out that Luther had formed his peculiar
views “during a period of painful confusion of mind and trouble of
conscience,” and that at times when Holy Scripture did not entirely
satisfy him he would even seemingly set Christ against Scripture, as
in the following passage: “You Papist, you insist much on Scripture,
but it is no more than a servant of Christ, and to it I will not listen.
But I am strong in Christ, Who is the true Lord and Emperor over
Scripture. I care nothing for any texts of Scripture, even though you
should bring forward many more against me; for I have the Lord and
Master of Scripture on my side,” etc. (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 59=col. 344).</p>

“Oh, dear little Pope-Ass, don’t try to lick ... for you might

laugh at you and say: For shame, look what a mess the Pope-Ass
has got itself into.” “You are a rude ass, you Pope-Ass, and that you

or relieve myself in the way of nature, they must take it all as articles
of faith ... but all is sealed with devil’s ordure&mdash;in the Decretals&mdash;and

<i>seq.</i>, 169). One word, used in this connection, and spelt by Luther
“Fartz,” he employs in endless variations. Pope Paul III. he calls
“Eselfartz-Bapst,” “Bapst Fartzesel,” “Fartzesel-Bapst” and
“Eselbapstfartz.” “We see,” remarks Conrad Lange, “how the
apparition of the Roman monstrosity continued to act upon his
imagination, and how, even at the close of his life, it still appeared
to him suited to excite the masses in the religious struggle.” “Der

p. 148 (Nuremberg edition, 1566, p. 157). Cp. “Briefwechsel,” 13, p. 11,
and what Weller says (vol. vi., xxxviii. 2) of the two dead people raised to
life by Luther. In the German “Table-Talk” (“Werke,” Erl. ed., 59, p. 3)
Luther says of prayer: “The prayer of the Church performs great
miracles. In our own time it has restored three dead men to life; first
me, for often I was sick unto death, then my housekeeper Katey, who
was also sick unto death, finally Philip Melanchthon, who, anno 1540,
lay sick unto death at Weimar. Though <i>Liberatio a morbis et corporalibus
periculis</i> is not the best of miracles, yet it must not be allowed to pass
unheeded <i>propter infirmitatem in fide</i>. To me it is a much greater miracle
that God Almighty should every day bestow the grace of baptism, give
Himself in the Sacrament of the altar and absolve <i>et liberat a peccato,
a morte et damnatione æterna</i>. These are great miracles.” Cp. Förstemann’s
notes, “Tischreden,” 2, p. 230.</p>

gift of predicting; if he has been spoken of as a prophet, this
depended on the sense in which the word was used; he had rightly
foreseen much of what would happen to the German Church,” etc.
“Neither did God bestow on him the gift of working miracles,” but
he did not need it, since he preached no new doctrine and what he
taught he proved sufficiently from Holy Scripture; indeed, the
Reformation as a whole was not miraculous, since God had not intervened
in it in any extraordinary manner.</p>

Hilten’s and who was with him during his last days, in Enders, “Luthers
Briefwechsel,” 7, p. 198; cp. also the literature quoted by Enders.
Hilten’s prophecy, and likewise that of the Roman Franciscan, was
nevertheless, in 1872, quoted in Luther’s favour by C. F. Kahnis,
Professor of Theology at the University of Leipzig, in his “Gesch. der
deutschen Reformation,” 1, p. 178. He says: “What the Spirit of
God in him bore witness to in condemnation of the fallen Church of
the Middle Ages, was attested by prophetic utterances.” “While
Luther was at school at Eisenach, a monk named Hilten languished
in the prison of the Franciscan convent,” etc. He appeals to Mathesius,

“Werke,” Weim. ed., 8, p. 561; Erl. ed., 28, p. 139 f. “Vom
Missbrauch der Messen.” The passage commences: “When a child
I frequently heard a prophecy current in the country, viz. that an
Emperor Frederick would rescue the Holy Sepulchre.” This had been
misunderstood and applied to the tomb at Jerusalem; but it is “of
the nature of prophecies to be fulfilled before being understood.” The
passage on Frederick also occurs in the Latin text of this work, published
previously under the title “<i>De abroganda missa</i>.” In “Werke,”
Weim. ed., 8, p. 475, we there read: “<i>Videtur mihi ista (prophetia) in hoc
Fridrico nostro impleta.</i>” Luther then proceeds to recount in a pleasant
vein certain doubtful interpretations.</p>

Forcelli it also sometimes means “to perform,” “to do.” Cp. Horace,

1, 2, 7: “<i>Quid designavit? Fores effregit.</i>”</p>

Bindseil bases his work really depends on the statements of Luther’s
pupil Lauterbach. Here Luther’s words run: “<i>Quoties meam uxorem

As to this, Wrampelmeyer, a Protestant, remarks (p. 451) in his
edition of Cordatus’s Diary, mentioned above: “The German ‘Table-Talk,’
which agrees almost entirely with the Latin version, does not, in
Erl. ed., 60, p. 110, and Förstemann, 3, p. 122, contain these words, but
replaces them by the following: ‘I have frequently made use of
various means in order to drive away Satan, but it was of no use.’
It is clear that words so compromising gave offence and that others were
substituted instead of those given in the Latin text, which formed
the basis of the German ‘Table-Talk.’ According to the Notes of Cordatus,
however, Luther’s words appear in quite a different light.” “The
words of the Latin ‘Table-Talk’: ‘<i>ut de puella pulchra, avaritia, ebrietate</i>,’
have also been replaced in the German version by more harmless
expressions.”</p>

“Opp.,” Antwerpiæ, 1706, 3, p. 242 <i>seq.</i>; p. 589 <i>seq.</i> Aug. Hardeland
(“Gesch. der speziellen Seelsorge in der vorreformatorischen Kirche
und der Kirche der Reformation,” Berlin, 1898, p. 261) remarks:
“The idea that we must always do the exact opposite of what the
devil suggests, is the leading one in Gerson’s Tractate ‘<i>De remediis
contra pusillanimitatem</i>.’” He is of opinion that, in advising Weller to
sin, Luther was “using this maxim of Gerson’s, and probably only
meant: ‘Do not be afraid to do what, from the standpoint of your
scrupulosity, appears to be sinful.’” Luther’s advice, however, was not
intended for a scrupulous person predisposed to exaggeration or to
narrowness of heart, but for all those who despaired of their salvation and
were unable to believe in Luther’s doctrine of the forgiveness of sins
and in his assurance of salvation. “<i>Cogitationes immanissimæ</i>,”
Luther calls Weller’s ideas, “<i>quando diabolus reos (nos) egerit mortis et
inferni.... In æternum condemnaberis?</i>” Weller, the disciple, has
first to learn: “<i>novi quendam, qui passus est pro me ac satisfecit</i>,” etc.</p>

“Briefwechsel,” 3, p. 208. The letter no longer exists in its
entirety. One portion, however, became known and was published by
Joh. Aurifaber in 1556 in the first vol. of Luther’s letters (p. 343) and
described as “<i>Fragmentum epistolæ D.M. Lutheri ad Philippum
Melanchthonem ex Pathmo scriptæ, a. MDXXI., repertum in bibliotheca
Georgii Spalatini</i>.” Melanchthon had possibly sent the extract to
Spalatin when the latter was troubled regarding his own salvation.</p>

Passages tallying with the “<i>Esto peccator</i>” are to be found elsewhere
in Luther’s writings. Cp. for instance his letter of 1516 (vol. i.,
p. 88 f.) to Spenlein, where he says: “<i>Cave, ne aliquando ad tantam
puritatem aspires, ut peccator tibi videri nolis, imo esse. Christus enim
nonnisi in peccatoribus habitat.... Igitur nonnisi in illo pacem
invenies.</i>” In “Opp. lat. var.,” 1, p. 236 <i>seq.</i>, it is likewise explained
why one must be a great sinner; he insists that “<i>credenti omnia sunt
auctore Christo possibilia</i>” and condemns strongly “<i>affectus propriæ
iustitiæ</i>,” until he arrives at the paradox, “<i>Ideo est peccatum, ut in
peccatis apti ad spem simus</i>” (p. 239). In perfect harmony with such
early statements is the letter he wrote towards the end of his life to
Spalatin when the latter was sunk in melancholy; here he says:
“<i>Nimis tener hactenus fuisti peccator.... Iunge te nobis veris magnis
et duris peccatoribus</i>”; he must, so Christ speaking through Luther
tells him, hold alone to faith in the Divine mercy. August 21, 1544,

Köhler here quotes Denifle (“Luther,” p. 442; ed. 2, p. 465), who
gives these words in their full context from Luther’s MS. Commentary
on Romans. We may point out that Denifle quotes an abundance of
similar passages from Luther’s works, amongst which those taken from
his early Commentary on Romans are particularly interesting.</p>

<i>Ibid.</i>, 11, p. 197, Sermon in 1523 from Rörer’s notes. Though in
the passages just quoted he lays great stress on the fact, that nothing
is needed on our part for the obtaining of forgiveness (not even as
Catholics taught any co-operation on our part with God’s helping
grace), yet he speaks here again of the “emptying of the heart of all
affection” for creatures, and of the “works” which proceed from a
heart that is purified by faith. “Werke,” Weim. ed., 9, p. 409. “If
you have now the wedding garment, then serve your neighbour,
give yourself up to him entirely, take compassion on him. [For] the
Christian life consists in faith in God and charity towards our neighbour.”

charity, Christs to every man.” <i>Ibid.</i>, 11, p. 197.</p>

“Werke,” Weim. ed., 34, 2, p. 21. Certain prayers spoken by
Luther at critical moments, which appear in Protestant biographies,
more particularly the older ones, are purely legendary. So, for instance,
his solemn prayer at Worms: “O God, my God, stand by me against
all the wit and wisdom of the world,” etc. (Uckert, “Luthers Leben,” 2,
Gotha, 1817, p. 6, and also in Walch’s edition of Luther’s Works, 10,
p. 1720). From Melanchthon’s time (<i>ibid.</i>, 21, Nachl. 354) and that of
such enthusiastic pupils of Luther as Spangenberg, it became the
custom to extol Luther as a man of prayer. Spangenberg even
declares that “no one can deny” that Luther during his lifetime
“checked and prevented God’s chastisements, wars and desolation”
by means of his “Christian prayers, so full of faith.” See Preface to
his “Lutherus Theander,” No. 18. A certain Protestant theological
periodical assured its readers quite recently, that “Luther spent three
hours of his working day in prayer”; it is true that people pray even
in the Roman Church, but amid much “superficiality and desecration.”</p>

For biographical data concerning these, see Kroker, “Luthers
Tischreden in der Mathesischen Sammlung,” Einl., p. 8 ff. For Rörer’s
Collections of the Table-talk, etc., cp. G. Koffmane, “Die hds. Überlieferung
von Werken Luthers,” 1907, p. xviii. ff., and Kroker, “Rörers
Handschriftenbände und Luthers Tischreden” (“Archiv. f. Reformationsgesch,”
5, 1908, p. 337 ff., and 7, 1910, p. 57 ff.). Among the occasional
guests was Ch. Gross, Magistrate at Wittenberg, who is mentioned
in Luther’s letters (De Wette, 5, p. 410) in 1541 as “<i>praefectus noster</i>.”
In his Catholic days the last had served for three years as one of the
bearers of the Pope’s sedan; a great traveller, he was noted as an
excellent conversationalist and a thorough man of the world. There
can be no doubt that he reported to Luther many of the malicious and
unveracious tales current of Roman morals, which the latter made use
of in his attacks on Popery. Cp. with regard to him “Colloq.,” ed.
Bindseil, 3, p. 424, and 1, p. 372 (where accounts, probably by him,
follow), “Werke,” Erl. ed., 62, p. 431 (“Tischreden”). He makes
unseemly jests on the Latin word for “art,” and it appears highly
probable that he was the “M. Christo,” whom we meet with in Kroker,
p. 175, n. 287, in Luther’s Table-Talk of 1540, whose “<i>calida natura</i>”
is mentioned in excuse of a love affair. This gives an answer to Kroker’s
question: “Who is this Magister Christophorus?” We learn from
Bindseil’s “Colloquia” that Christopher Gross was anxious to become
a widower because his wife was a “<i>vetula</i>.”</p>

For the full titles of the publications referred to here and elsewhere
under an abbreviated form as “Tagebuch,” “Aufzeichnungen,” etc.,
see the Bibliography at the commencement of vol. i. of the present work.
Besides these collections heed must be paid to the old German Table-Talk
in the Erlangen edition (“Werke,” 57-62) and the Latin Table-Talk
in Bindseil. Only exceptionally do we quote the other editions, such
as the Latin one by Rebenstock, and the older and more recent German
editions of Förstemann and Bindseil. Moreover, the Table-Talk in
most cases merely serves to prove that this or that idea was expressed
more or less in the language recorded, not that Luther
actually uttered every word of it. The historical circumstances under
which the words were uttered are in most cases unknown. Kroker’s
publication has been of great service in determining the dates of the
various collections. As regards the present position of the investigation
of the sources whence the Table-Talk is derived, see Köstlin-Kawerau,
2, pp. 479-481, and P. Smith, “Luther’s Table-Talk,” New York, 1907,
which sums up the results arrived at in Germany.</p>

Table-Talk is at present appearing. In it are found the accounts given
by Veit Dietrich, and another important collection dating from the
earlier portion of the third decade of the sixteenth century. Vol. ii.,
commencing with Schlaginhaufen, is already in the hands of the

Vol. i., Preface, p. vii. In the Latin edition of the Table-Talk
Bindseil, in spite of the scruples alluded to above (n. 1), speaks in
praise of the Table-Talk, and makes his own the words of J. Müllensiefen
(1857). The Table-Talk showed Luther as “the noblest offshoot
of his nation”; it is true the coarseness and plainness of speech are
inexcusable, but it all contributes towards the “perfect characterisation
of the great man,” for “the wrinkles and furrows are part of his portrait”
(“Coll.,” ed. Bindseil, 1, p. xiii.). Luther’s opponents were,
however, of a different opinion even in the early days. G. Steinhausen,
in his “Deutsche Kulturgesch.,” Leipzig, 1904, p. 513, quotes
Johann Fickler of Salzburg, who describes the Table-Talk as “full of
obscene and stinking jests,” and compares it to the erotic products
of the Epicureans. Steinhausen himself is loath to go so far.</p>

Wetzer and Welte, “KL.,”³ art. “Aurifaber.” H. Böhmer likewise
admits that: “Although their [the principal witnesses’: Dietrich,
Lauterbach, and Mathesius] statements must always be critically
examined, yet it is established, that they have preserved for us an exceptional
number of data concerning Luther’s life, acts, and opinions.
They supply us with what on the whole is an accurate account, arranged
in chronological order, which brings the real Luther almost as closely
before us as his own letters and writings.” In his objections against
the “principal witnesses” he does not pay sufficient attention to the
existence of the original notes (“Luther im Lichte der neueren Forschung,”²
1910, p. 105). Protestant theologians and historians of
Luther are now in the habit of laying stress on the Table-Talk, no less
than on Luther’s other works, and that even in the case of weighty and
controverted questions. Examples might be quoted from Loofs,
Drews, G. Kawerau, J. Köstlin, G. Ward, etc.</p>

“RE. f. prot. Theol.,”³ art. “Aurifaber.” In the “Abh. der
Kgl. Ges. d. Wissensch. Götting., Phil.-hist. Kl., N.F.,” 1, Wilhelm
Meyer deals with the Collections of Lauterbach and Aurifaber. In the
same way Kawerau points out in his “Studien und Kritiken,” 81,
1908, p. 338, “the importance of these notes for Luther’s biography
and for a knowledge of his home life.” Cp. Kawerau, <i>ibid.</i>, p. 354, on
the old re-arrangement according to the subject-matter. The “authenticity”
of the sayings which occur in these revised editions can be
proved in many instances from the original writings and from the light
thrown on them by parallel passages now in print, but the “dates”
are another matter. Where, in the present work, any date is taken from
the revised editions, it rests solely on the authority of the latter. Cp.
Kroker’s remarks on the Table-Talk of 1540 in the “Archiv f. Reformationsgesch.,”
1908, above, p. 218, n. 2. On Aurifaber’s re-arrangement
of the Table-Talk, see Cristiani, “Revue de questions historiques,” 91,
1912, p. 113.</p>

Lauterbach, Luther’s pupil, who was also the author of the Diary,

Cp. N. Paulus, <i>ibid.</i>, p. 40; Kroker, pp. 156, 158, 262. Kroker
says (p. 158), “Luther probably made use of a colloquial word for
phallus, or something similar.” Luther is complaining of the excesses
to which the Catholics gave themselves up on pilgrimages, and which
the Pope constantly indulged in. One MS. there cited omits the passage
altogether. The Table-Talk of Mathesius (p. 141) contains the following
speech of Luther’s in 1540 under the title “<i>Exemplum verecundiae
Lutheri</i>”: “<i>Rochlicensis princeps. Is interrogabat ‘Qui vocatur
verum</i> [sic] <i>de domina vestra natante cum equite per aquas? Non volo
autem obscoenum audire sed verum.</i>’ Ich mein, das heisst: die ×
ausgeschwembt”. For the liberty which Aurifaber permits himself
in the matter of toning down and weakening the original text of the
Table-Talk, cp., for instance, the remarks in the Preface to the Cordatus
Collection. What the latter gives in all its crudity (see the twenty-four
passages there quoted by Wrampelmeyer) Aurifaber either does not
reproduce at all or does so in an inoffensive form, or accompanied with
such expressions as “to speak decently,” etc. Cordatus knew and
acknowledged that it was an “<i>audax facinus</i>” to write down all he
heard, but his opinion was that “<i>pudorem vincebat utilitas</i>”; Luther,
who was watching his work, never gave him to understand by so much
as one word that it did not meet with his approval.</p>

G. Evers (“Martin Luther,” 6, p. 701), for instance, says that
“In his Table-Talk we find not merely plain-spoken, but really cynical
discourses, and much which to us sounds obscene. Still, his admirers
may possibly be right when they absolve him of indecency or of any
intention to arouse sensual passion.”</p>

<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 201. Cp. Luther’s insolent language towards the
Pope in his other writings and letters; for instance, when he
declares that the Princes who were not on his own side were “dem
Papst in den Arsch gebacken” (“Werke,” Erl. ed., 45, p. 398); or:
“I s&mdash;&mdash; on the dispensation of the legate and his master” (Briefwechsel,
8, p. 53; cp. p. 113); or “that Pope and Legate ‘im Arsch
wollten lecken’” (“Briefwechsel,” 8, p. 233). As early as 1518, in a
Lenten sermon, he shows his predisposition to crudity: “If we drag
our good works into the light, ‘so soll der Teufel den Arsch daran
wischen,’ as indeed he does” (“Werke,” Weim. ed., 1, p. 276). Cp.
also his discourse in 1515 against the “Little Saints” (vol. i., p. 69 f.).
In the saying just referred to he is playing on a coarse proverb. In his
collection of proverbs (not intended for publication, but edited by
Thiele) he has accumulated quite a number of filthy sayings, those containing
the word “Dreck” being unpleasantly numerous. Many of the
obscenities occurring in his sermons and writings were suggested by
proverbs which themselves reek too much of the stable, but which he
sometimes still further embellishes. The manner in which he uses the
gross word “Farzen” with reference to the Pope or the monks can be
seen in “Werke,” Weim. ed., 8, p. 715, and Erl. ed., 25², p. 74. In one
of his attacks on the Jews he says: “Kiss the pig on its ‘Pacem’ and
‘Pirzl,’” etc. (“Werke,” Erl. ed., 32, p. 211); and again: “Here,
here for a kiss! The devil has ‘in die Hosen geschmissen und
den Bauch abermal geleeret.’ This is indeed a holy thing for the Jews,
and all would-be Jews to kiss, eat, drink, and worship, while the devil
in his turn must eat and drink what his disciples ‘speien, oben und
unten auswerfen können.’ Host and guest have indeed met, have
cooked and served the meat.... The devil is feasting with his English
[angelic?] snout and gobbles up greedily whatever ‘der Juden unteres
und oberes Maul speiet und spritzet.’ Yes, that is the dainty he enjoys”
(“Werke,” Erl. ed., 32, p. 282).</p>

Such was the writer’s indignation that his words are scarcely
worthy of a Humanist. The following comes from the “<i>Responsio ad

under More’s own name: “<i>Nihil habet in ore (Lutherus) praeter
latrinas, merdas, stercora, quibus foedius et spurcius quam ullus unquam
scurra scurratur.... Si pergat scurrilitate ludere nec aliud in ore
gestare quam sentinas, cloacas, latrinas, merdas, stercora, faciant quod
volent alii, nos ex tempore capiemus consilium, velimusne sic bacchantem

<i>Ibid.</i>, 518=140. We may add some further statements characteristic
of Luther’s unseemly language on the necessity of marriage
and the alleged abuses on the Catholic side. Of these passages the
first two are for obvious reasons given in Latin.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“<i>Major pars puellarum in monasteriis positarum non potest voluntarie
statum suum observare.... Puella non potest esse sine viro, sicut non
sine esu, potu et somno. Ideo Deus dedit homini membra, venas, fluxus et
omnia, quae ad generandum inserviunt. Qui his rebus obsistit, quid
aliud facit, quam velle ut ignis non urat?... Ubi castitas involuntaria
est, natura non desistit ab opere suo; caro semen concipit sicut creata est
a Deo; venae secundum genus suum operantur. Tunc incipiunt fluxus
et peccata clandestina, quae s. Paulus mollitiem vocat</i> (1 Cor. vi. 10).
<i>Et, ut crude dicam, propter miseram necessitatem, quod non fluit in
carnem, fluit in vestimenta. Id deinde accusare et confiteri verentur....
Vide, hoc ipsum voluit diabolus, docens te coercere et domare naturam,
quae non vult esse coacta</i>” (“Werke,” Weim. ed., 10, 2, p. 156 f.; Erl.
ed., 28, p. 199).</p>
<p class="pfc4">He had spoken in much the same way in the Tract against celibacy
which preceded in 1521 his book on Monastic Vows, and which appeared
again in the Church Sermons and also several times separately
(“Werke,” Weim. ed., 10, 1, 1, p. 694 ff.; Erl. ed., 10², p. 448 ff.;
Sermon on the Feast of the Three Kings, 1522): “<i>Ubi magna et
coelestis gratia non assistit, oportet naturam secundum ordinem suum
fluxus pati. Si non conveniunt vir et femina, natura tamen propriam
viam sequitur et indignatur; ita ut melius sit masculum et feminam esse
simul, sicut Deus (eos) creavit et natura vult.... Interrogo igitur, quid
consilii dabis ei, qui se continere non potest? Si dicis, inhibitione
utendum, respondeo, unum ex tribus secuturum esse: aut masculus et
femina sese conjungent, ut placuerit sicuti nunc fit sub sacerdotibus papistarum,
aut natura sponte sese solvet, aut, deficiente primo et secundo, sine
cessatione homo uretur et clam patietur. Hoc modo creasti martyrium diabolicum,
et fiet, ut vir mulieri deformissimae sese sociaret et mulier viro taediosissimo
prae malo impetu carnis. Ignoscant mihi aures pudicae, debeo
tractare animi morbos, sicut medicus tractat stercus et latrinam.... Tu facis,
ut ille pauper homo continuo corde peccet contra votum suum, et melius
fortasse sit, quod masculus nonnunquam secum habeat femellam et femina
juvenem.... At papa sinit eos fluxus pati, uri et torqueri sicut possunt,
ita ut eos habeam pro infantibus immolatis a populo Israel idolo igneo
Moloch ad concremandum.... Non vis impedire tandem aliquando,
quominus fornicentur, fluxibus maculentur et urantur?</i>” <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 108=
“<i>Si in singulis civitatibus forent vel quinque juvenes et quinque
puellae viginti annorum, integri, sine fluxibus naturae, tunc dicerem,
primitiva tempora apostolorum et martyrum rediisse. Nunc autem
qualem Sodomam et Gomorrham fecit diabolus ubicunque plane per istam
singularem castitatem votorum!</i>”</p>
<p class="pfc4">In the sermon on conjugal life, in 1522, he says: “It is true that the
man who does not marry is obliged to sin. How can it be otherwise,
seeing that God created man and woman to be fruitful and multiply?
But why do we not forestall sin by marriage?” (“ Werke,” Weim. ed.,
10, 2, p. 300; Erl. ed., 16², p. 537). In his latter years he penned the
following attack upon the older Church of which the obscenity vies
with its untruth: “The chaste Pope does not take a wife, yet all
women are his. The lily-white, chaste, shamefaced, modest, Holy
Father wears the semblance of chastity and refuses to take a wife
honourably and in the sight of God; but how many other women he
keeps, not only prostitutes, but married women and virgins, look at his
Court of Cardinals, his Bishoprics, Foundations, Courtesans, Convents,
Clergy, Chaplains, Schoolmasters and his whole curia, not to speak of
countless unnamable sins. Well, may God give us His grace and
punish both the Pope and Mohammed with all their devils!” (“Werke,”
Erl. ed., 65, p. 204, in the Preface to the writing: “Verlegung des
Alcoran Bruder Richardi,” 1542). It is simply an example of Luther’s
habitual misrepresentation when we read in one of his sermons dating
from 1524 (“Werke,” Weim. ed., 15, p. 667): “Up to this time marriage
has been a despised state, being termed a state of easy virtue; but
Scripture says: ‘Male and female He created them’ (Gen. i. 27):
that is enough for us. In practice we all extol this state. Oh, that all
men lived in it! Whoever has not been exempted by God, let him see
that he finds his like [a spouse].” Upon himself he looked as one
“exempted by God,” at least he declared in several passages of this
sermon, delivered in the very year of his marriage, that “by the Grace
of God he did not desire a wife; I have no need of a wife, but must
assist you in your necessity.” He himself could not yet make up his
mind to carry out what he urged so strongly upon others.</p>

As regards the authorities, Luther’s wish was that they should
interfere in the matter from the outset, and that strongly, although he
can scarcely have hoped to see this carried out in practice. “The
authorities must either coerce the woman or put her to death. Should
they not do this, the husband must imagine that his wife has been
carried off by brigands and look about him for another” (<i>ibid.</i>).</p>

was to say: “Permit me to enter into a secret marriage with your
brother, or your best friend,” etc. Luther is speaking of the case
“where a healthy woman had an impotent husband,” etc. He here
refers to the similar answer he had already given in his work: “On the
Babylonish Captivity” (“Werke,” Weim. ed., 6, p. 558; “Opp.

To Joachim von Weissbach, August 23, 1527, “Werke,” Erl. ed.,

concessi privatim aliquot coniugibus, qui leprosum vel leprosam haberent,
ut alium ducerent.</i>” Mathesius, “Tischreden,” p. 141. In a sermon of
1524 he says coarsely of an impotent wife: “I would not have such a
one beside me” (“Werke,” Weim. ed., 15, p. 560). The marriage bond
was also dissolved where husband or wife had become impotent “owing
to an evil spell”; his convictions forced him to teach this (<i>ibid.</i>,
p. 562).</p>

The question was thoroughly gone into by Rockwell, “Die Doppelehe
Philipps von Hessen,” 1904, p. 202 ff., who says: “About 1536 a
change took place in the attitude of the Wittenbergers towards marriage
with relatives-in-law” (p. 216). “Thus it is evident that Luther’s
views underwent a change” (p. 217). For the answer to the question
how far this change was due to the hope of winning over Henry VIII.
to the New Evangel, see vol. iv., xxi. 1.</p>

of this conversation dating from 1540, 11-19 June. It begins: “<i>Ego
occallui sum rusticus et durus Saxo</i> [a pun on the Latin word] <i>ad
eiusmodi</i> X” (Luther probably made use of a word against which
the pen of the writer revolted. Kroker’s note). Later: “<i>Ipsi
(papistae) occidunt homines, nos laboramus pro vita et ducimus plures
uxores.</i>” The end of this discourse, as Loesche and Kroker have
shown, contains verbal reminiscences of Terence, with whom Luther
must have been well acquainted from the days of his youth.</p>

“<i>Saluta tuam conjugem suavissime, verum ut id tum facias cum
in thoro suavissimis amplexibus et osculis Catharinam tenueris, ac
sic cogitaveris: en hunc hominem, optimam creaturulam Dei mei,
donavit mihi Christus meus, sit illi laus et gloria. Ego quoque cum
divinavero diem qua has acceperis, ea nocte simili opere meam amabo
in tui memoriam et tibi par pari referam. Salutat et te et costam
tuam mea costa in Christo. Gratia vobiscum. Amen.</i>” Letter of
December 6, 1525. An esteemed Protestant historian of Luther
declared recently in the “Theol. Studien und Kritiken” that he was
charmed with Luther’s “wholesome and natural spirit, combined with
such hearty piety.” The explanation is that this historian disagrees
with the “shy reticence” now observed in these matters as at variance
with the “higher moral sense,” and looks on what “Thomas says
of the <i>actus matrimonialis</i>” as an “entire perversion of the sound ethics
of matrimony.” Another historian “thanks Luther warmly for this
letter,” whilst a third scholar extols “the depth of feeling with which
Luther, as a married man, comprehends the mystery of neighbourly
love within marriage.”</p>

the paragraph in question thus: “As occasion arose all sorts
of wise sayings fell from his lips. The man was full of grace and the
Holy Ghost, for which reason all who sought counsel from him as from
God’s own prophet found what they needed. One of them once asked
whether it would be a real marriage were a young fellow,” etc.</p>

Venetiis, 1547. In 1548 Johann Cochlæus collected Catharinus’s
strictures on Luther out of three of the former’s writings, and entitled
his work “De persona et doctrina M. Lutheri judicium fratris A.
Catharini,” etc., Moguntiae, 1548. The above quotation appears in
this collection, fol. C. 2a. For an account of the great services rendered
by Catharinus, who for all his piety was yet too prejudiced and combative,
see Joseph Schweizer, “Ambrosius Catharinus Politus,” 1910
(“Reformationsgeschichtl. Studien und Texte,” ed. J. Greving, Hft.
11 and 12). Cp. the remarks of others living at a distance given below,

“Werke,” Erl. ed., 65, p. 170. It has been asserted by controversialists
that another version of the German translation of these
Theses had already been made in 1545 from which some of the most
“swinish expressions” were omitted through motives of modesty.
Of any such revision during Luther’s lifetime nothing is, however,
known. Probably the reference is to Caspar Cruciger’s translation
which is placed next to the older translation in Walch’s edition of
Luther’s works (19, p. 2258). But examination proves that Cruciger
by no means weakened the wording, indeed, his rendering is in some
instances even stronger, for instance, that of Theses 35, 42, 61, and 64.
The “Swine-theologians of Louvain,” alluded to in his title, do not
appear here in the original German edition.</p>

incurable melancholy which finally brought him to the grave (January
16, 1546). Cp. J. Wagner, “Georg Spalatin,” Altenburg, 1830, p. 105 f.
Luther was unacquainted with the actual cause of his fears, but says
that some persons thought they were due to remorse for having given
his sanction to an illegal marriage.</p>

not in his handwriting, nor could Luther well have composed anything

in the Vatican there was only one quarto book written by Luther.</p>

Under the heading “Der ‘gute Trunk’ in den Lutheranklagen”
the present writer published an article in the “Hist. Jahrb.,” 26, 1905,
p. 479 ff., which under a revised form is given anew in the following
pages. In view of the strong verdicts frequently pronounced upon
Luther’s love of drink, we may point out that P. Albert Weiss, O. P.,
in his “Lutherpsychologie” (Mainz, 1906, p. 185 f.; 2nd ed., p. 274),
goes so far as to declare he was inclined to “tone down this or that
opinion expressed by Grisar,” but that he was thankful that he had
“treated the subject with such moderation.”</p>

of the Elector Johann Frederick in his work, “Wider Hans Worst”:

to feel that Urbanus&mdash;from the title of the sermon&mdash;treads dangerous
ground, and would to-day be considered quite scandalously lax.”
Cp. N. P[aulus] in the Köln. Volksztng., 1904, No. 623: on Luther’s
admission “I also tipple.”</p>

Letter of February 20, 1510, “Briefwechsel,” 1, p. 431: “<i>expositus

uses the word “<i>crapulatus</i>” in the sense of “<i>ebrius</i>,” “Werke,” Weim.
ed., 3, pp. 559 and 596. In the larger Commentary on Galatians, however,
a distinction is made between “<i>ebrietas</i>” and “<i>crapula</i>,” 3, pp.
47 and 53; cp. the smaller Commentary (1519), Weim. ed., 2, p. 591:
“<i>Commessatio, quae</i> Lc. xxi. 34 [<i>crapula</i>] <i>dicitur; sicut ebrietas nimium
bibendo, ita crapula nimium comedendo gravat corda</i>.”</p>

that Luther was a drunkard” were therefore false. Köstlin-Kawerau,

W. Walther (“Theol. Literaturblatt,” 1906, p. 473), on the
strength of a photograph, now declares “<i>Johannes</i>” to be “the most
likely” reading, and rightly excludes “<i>plenus</i>” on p. 586 of his book,
“Für Luther.” H. Böhmer (“Luther,”², p. 116) is also in favour of
“<i>Johannes</i>.” G. Kawerau for his part thought, judging from the
photograph, that “<i>plures</i>” might be read instead of “<i>plenus</i>,” in
which N. Müller agrees with him; he could not, however, understand
what “<i>plures</i>” meant here. “Studien und Kritiken,” 1908, p. 603.
On re-examination of the original I was forced to decide against
“<i>plures</i>.” K. Löffler (“Hist. Jahrb.,” 30, 1909, p. 317) proposes
“<i>Doctor parvus</i>,” but this is excluded by the characters, though the
sense would be reasonable enough. “<i>Johannes</i>” may quite well be the
reading, since from 1527 Luther was in the habit of adding greetings
from Katey and Hans in his letters.</p>

Cp. Kolde, <i>ibid.</i>, p. xxiv. ff. K. Müller, “Die Symbole des
Luthertums” (“Preuss. Jahrb.,” 63, 1889, p. 121 ff.), points out why
Luther looked askance at any Symbolic Books; the fact is he did not
recognise any Church having “a legal and ordered constitution and
laws such as would call for Symbolic Books.” G. Krüger says (“Philipp
Melanchthon,” 1906, p. 18 f.): “The Confession and its Apology were
wrongly interpreted by the narrow-minded orthodoxy of later years
as laws binding on faith. And yet why did Melanchthon go on improving
and polishing them if he did not regard them as his own
personal books, which he was free to alter just as every author may
when he publishes a new edition of his work?” Yet they were “the
genuine charter of evangelical belief as understood by our Reformers.”</p>

Cp. J. Ficker, “Die Konfutation des Augsburger Bekenntnisses,”
Gotha and Leipzig, 1891, where the “<i>Confutatio</i>” is reprinted in its
original form (p. 1 ff.). Adolf Harnack says (“Lehrb. der Dogmengesch.,”
3<sup>4</sup>, 1910, p. 670, n. 3): “The duplicity of the ‘<i>Augustana</i>’
has become still more apparent in Ficker’s fine book on the
‘<i>Confutatio</i>.’ The confuters were unfortunately right in many of
the passages they adduced in proof of the lack of openness apparent
in the Confession. In the summer of 1530 Luther was
not so well satisfied with the book as he had been in May, and
he too practically admitted the objections on the score of dissimulation
made by the Catholics.” Harnack quotes in support of “the
dissimulation” the passage at the end of Article xxi. (“Symb.
Bücher”<sup>10</sup>, p. 47): “<i>Hæc fere summa est doctrinæ apud nos</i> [Harnack:
<i>suos</i>] <i>in qua cerni potest nihil inesse, quod discrepet a scripturis vel ab
ecclesia catholica vel ab ecclesia romana, quatenus ex scriptoribus nota est</i>.”
On p. 684 Harnack says concerning the Confession of Augsburg: “That
the gospel of the Reformation has found masterly expression in the
<i>Augustana</i> I cannot admit. The <i>Augustana</i> was the foundation of a
doctrinal Church; to it was really due the narrowing of the Reformation
movement, and, besides, it was not entirely sincere.... Its statements,
both positive and negative, are intentionally incomplete in
many important passages; its diplomatic readiness to meet the older
Church is painful, and the way in which it uses the sectarians [Zwinglians]
as a whipping-boy and deals out ‘anathemas’ is not only uncharitable
but unjust, and dictated not merely by spiritual zeal but by
worldly prudence.” Still he finds “jewels in the earthen vessel”;
“but, as regards the author, we may say without hesitation that
Melanchthon in this instance undertook&mdash;was forced to undertake&mdash;a
task for which his talents and his character did not fit him.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">As regards the position of the <i>Augustana</i> in the history of Protestantism,
Harnack remarks on the same page, that the free teaching of the
Reformation then began to develop into a “Rule of Faith.” “When to
this was added the pressure from without, and when, under the storms
which were gathering (fanatics, Anabaptists), courage to say anything
<i>quod discrepet ab ecclesia catholica vel ab ecclesia romana, quatenus ex
scriptoribus nota est</i>, faded away, then the movement terminated in
the Confession of Augsburg, which while not actually denying the
principle of evangelical freedom, nevertheless begins to pour the new
wine into old vessels (cp. even the Articles of Marburg). Did the
Reformation (of the sixteenth century) do away with the old dogma?
It is safer to answer this question in the negative than in the affirmative.
But if we admit that it attacked its foundations, as our Catholic
opponents rightly accuse us of doing, and that it was a mighty principle
rather than a new system of doctrine, then it must also be admitted
that the altogether conservative attitude of the Reformation
towards ancient dogma, inclusive of its premisses, for instance, Original
Sin and the Fall, belongs, not to its principle, but simply to its history.”</p>

“arranged by the Elector for the amendment of the conditions”
which Luther had exposed “to his sovereign with a heavy heart, viz.
‘how the parsonages are in a state of misery, no one giving or paying
anything’; the common man heeds neither preacher nor parson, so that,
unless some strong measures are taken by Your Electoral Highness for
State maintenance of pastors and preachers, there will soon be neither
parsonages, nor schools, nor scholars, and so God’s Word and service will
come to an end.”</p>

Cp. his “<i>Apologia</i>” of the Augsburg Confession, Art. iv., “Symb.
Bücher,” p. 87, where, on the doctrine of Justification, the old German
translation runs: “Because the gainsayers know not nor understand
what the words of Scripture mean, what forgiveness of sins, or grace, or
faith, or justice is ... they have miserably robbed poor souls, to
whom it was a matter of life and death, of their eternal consolation.”
Page 90: “They do not know what the fear of death or the assaults of
the devil are ... when the heart feels the anger of God or the conscience
is troubled ... but the affrighted conscience knows well that
it is impossible to merit either <i>de condigno</i> or <i>de congruo</i>, and therefore
soon sinks into distrust and despair,” etc. Page 95: The new teaching
alone was able “to raise up our hearts even amidst the terrors of sin
and death,” etc. Hence Melanchthon insists in his “<i>Brevis discendæ
theologiæ ratio</i>” (“Corp. ref.,” 2, p. 458), that Bible study served “<i>ad
usum et ad tentationes superandas comparanda cognitio</i>.”</p>

after the publication of the “<i>Diatribe</i>”: “<i>Diu optavi Luthero prudentem
aliquem de hoc negotio antagonistam contingere</i>.” “His own
testimony (in 1536) is decisive as to the effect of Erasmus on his opinion
regarding free-will.” Ellinger, <i>ibid.</i>, p. 199. On the “<i>Diatribe</i>,” see our
vol. ii., p. 261 ff.</p>

Ellinger, <i>ibid.</i>, p. 202. In this he was of course inconsequent, for,
as Ellinger says, where it is a question of the religious life, he traces
everything back to the action of God. “It is easy to see, that, here,
as in Luther’s case (where the <i>Deus absconditus</i> plays a part), we have
merely an expedient.” <i>Ibid.</i></p>

Above, p. 324. He was being attacked on account of the stress he laid
on good works, so he wrote to Camerarius in December, 1536, but
though so many preachers were now shouting in stentorian tones that
it was erroneous to demand works, “posterity will be astonished that
an age so mad could ever have been, when such folly met with applause.”

Cp. above, p. 3 ff. It should be pointed out in order to supplement
the above statements of Haussleiter and Müller that Luther nevertheless
looks on faith as the acceptance of certain dogmas (cp. above, p. 14,
and vol. v., xxxiv. 1), and thus in some sense recognises a “rule of
faith,” and that not seldom in the most peremptory fashion he demands
obedience to the “injunctions of faith.”</p>

Karl Müller (“Symbole,” p. 127 f.) points out very truly that
Melanchthon was in the habit of appealing to Luther’s authority, who,
for his part, “claimed immutability for his own view of the Gospel”;
and further that later followers of Luther, for instance, Flacius, thanks
to this very principle, reverted to the real Luther, and furiously
assailed Melanchthon for his deformation of the Reformer. According
to G. Krüger, “Melanchthon,” p. 12, Melanchthon “in his revisions
(of the ‘<i>Loci</i>’) cut himself more and more adrift from Luther, not
always happily, but rather to the detriment of the cause.” Page 25:
“Many are of opinion that the glorious seed of the German Reformation
would have borne much richer fruit had Melanchthon been different
from what he was.” Yet Krüger also says: “Should the Luther for
whom we long ever come, then let us hope that a Melanchthon will be
his right-hand man, that, with the advent of the Titan who overthrows
the old and founds the new, the spirit of peace and kindliness may still
prevail to the blessing to our Fatherland and Church.” What the aims
of the new Luther and new Melanchthon are to be, the author fails to
state.</p>

Paulus, “Luther und die Gewissensfreiheit,” p. 47 ff. Paulus
quotes from a pamphlet of Melanchthon’s&mdash;which escaped the notice
of the editors of his works&mdash;entitled “Prozess, wie es soll gehalten
werden mit den Wiedertäufern,” and dated 1557. Here we read
that even the Anabaptist articles which did not concern the secular
government were to be punished as blasphemies, as for instance the
rejection of infant baptism and the denial of the Trinity. Such articles
were not to be regarded as of no account, “for the Jewish fallacy that
Christ did not exist previous to His Incarnation is plainly blasphemous,
and so is the denial of original sin,” etc. Then follows the list of
penalties. The memorandum is signed by the theologians Melanchthon,
J. Brenz, J. Marbach, J. Andreae, G. Karg, P. Eber, J. Pistorius
and J. Rungius.</p>

“Many of the people,” he writes in 1524, “attach themselves to
Luther as the champion of freedom; they are weary of the good old
customs ... many of them think that Luther merely teaches contempt
of human traditions.” (In the <i>Epitome</i> addressed to the Landgrave
of Hesse [above, p. 348, n. 1].) Cp. Döllinger, <i>loc. cit.</i>, 3, p. 301.
He laments in similar fashion the results of Luther’s behaviour in 1527,
complaining that the people had become “over-confident and had
lost the sense of fear” because they heard nothing about penance.
This one-sided preaching of the Gospel resulted “in greater errors and
sins than had ever existed before.” Döllinger, <i>ibid.</i>, 3, p. 302. Melanchthon
regarded the writings of his friend, particularly on account of their
exaggeration, with “ever-increasing distrust.” “The great man’s
boisterousness began to alarm him.... There is no doubt that it was
from this quarter that the misgivings first arose which nipped and
caused to wither the blossoms of their previous so intimate relationship.”
Thus Ellinger, “Melanchthon,” p. 187.</p>

Ellinger, <i>ibid.</i>, p. 313: “He probably made use here of an intentionally
ambiguous phrase in order to curry favour with the Bishop, for
it is clear that he never meant to promote a restoration of the hierarchical
order, though Cricius may well have supposed this from his letter.
Hence we see that in the execution of his plans, Melanchthon was not
above having recourse to craft.”</p>

Letter of October 27, 1532. For its publication by T. Wierzbowski
see Kawerau, p. 78, n. 17. Kawerau rightly emphasises the
fact that, according to the text of the letter, Melanchthon refuses
to break with Luther merely “on the weak ground that he, as a right-minded
man (<i>vir bonus</i>), could not make up his mind to approve, let
alone admire, the cruel and bloodthirsty plans of the Romanists....
Should the ‘<i>moderata consilia</i>’ prevail amongst the Catholic bishops,
then he would be quite willing to come to terms.... We cannot but
see how gladly he would have taken refuge in a haven where he would
be safe from the theological storm. This letter shows him as a moderate,
and, at the same time, as a true representative of Humanist
interests.” For the further efforts of Cricius, who wrote in 1535, that
he was acting on behalf of, or at least with the express sanction of,
the Pope and the Cardinals, see Kawerau, p. 18 ff. Melanchthon’s
writing of August, 1532, to the Elector-Cardinal Albert of Mayence,
in which, in the most respectful terms, he begs the Primate of Germany,
so hated by Luther, “to procure a milder remedy (cp. ‘<i>moderata
consilia</i>’) for the dissensions in the Churches,” is also of importance;
all right-minded men in Europe (<i>boni omnes</i>) were looking to him.
“Corp. ref.,” 2, p. 611 <i>seq.</i> In these letters we see his earnest efforts
“to bring about peace and avert civil war,” as he writes to Erasmus.</p>

This tendency is also manifest in Melanchthon’s many labours
for the promotion of education. In place of the old, independent
Universities of the Middle Ages, enjoying ecclesiastical freedom and
partaking of a quasi-international character, there sprang up, wherever
Melanchthon’s influence prevailed, High Schools with a more limited
horizon destined to supply the sovereign of the land with servants for
the State, officials and preachers, but, above all, to safeguard the true
Evangel. “All the reformed Universities established at Melanchthon’s
instance,” remarks Carl Sell, a Protestant theologian, “Marburg,
Tübingen, Frankfort-on-the-Oder, Leipzig, Königsberg, Greifswald,
Heidelberg, Rostock, Jena, and finally Helmstädt, were State Universities,
and, like Wittenberg, intended as citadels of the pure faith.
Hence their professors were all bound by the new Confession....
The old, unfettered liberty of the Church’s Universities was now subordinated
to the ends and needs of the State.” “Philip Melanchthon
als Lehrmeister des protest. Deutschland,” 1897, p. 19. <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 11,
Sell thus characterises the State-Church promoted by Melanchthon and
by Luther likewise: “The German Reformation never succeeded in
producing a new ecclesiasticism. What grew up beneath its sway was
rather a confessional State, which declared itself at one with that form
of the Christian religion which the head of the State regarded as right.”</p>

August 28, 1535, “Corp. ref.,” 2, p. 917: The Court had prevailed on
him not to leave Wittenberg, chiefly because it regarded his presence as
indispensable owing to his power for mediating: “<i>me putant aliquanto
minus vehementem aut pertinacem esse quam sunt alii</i>.” He
regrets, with a hint at the Luther-enthusiasts, the “<i>democratia aut
tyrannis indoctorum</i>” prevalent in both Catholic and Lutheran
camps.... “<i>Non dissimulo evectos etiam esse nostros interdum [Greek: hyper
ta eskammena], et multa mitigavi.</i>”</p>

We are confronted with the following dilemma: “Either the strict
literal sense or the purely figurative; either the Catholic sense or the
Reformed.” Thus J. J. Herzog, “RE. f. prot. Theol. u. K.,” 1², p. 39.
Previously he had declared: “As a matter of fact the literal interpretation
involves the whole Catholic theory [of Transubstantiation] and
practice concerning the Sacrament of the Altar, not only the change
in the elements, the adoration of the Host, and the withholding of the
Chalice [?], but also the sacrificial character of the Mass.”&mdash;The complete
change of substance and the presence of Christ without any
remaining of the bread, as is well known, is vouched for by the oldest
liturgies. It is supported by the Fathers of the Church, who compare
the change here with that of the water made into wine at Cana and by
reference to the marvels of the Creation and of the Incarnation.
Moreover, in 1543, Luther did not regard a belief in Transubstantiation
as any obstacle to joining his party (“<i>nihil morati si quis eam alibi credat
vel non</i>”). To the Evangelicals at Venice, June 13, 1543, “Briefe,” ed.
De Wette, 5, p. 568.</p>

<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 86=162: He points out why Andrew Carlstadt, “so far
as my prayers may avail, shall not be permitted to come in again, but
shall again depart should he secure admittance, unless he becomes a
new Andrew, to which may God help him.” He had not interpreted
the law of Moses aright nor applied it to the authorities, but to the
common people. The authorities ought to forbid the country to such
preachers as did not teach quietly but drew the mob to them, pulled
down images and destroyed churches at their pleasure behind the
backs of the authorities. Carlstadt’s spirit and that of his followers was
a “spirit of murder and revolt.” Here he does not refer to the difference
on the doctrine of the Sacrament. Cp. Karl Müller, “Luther und
Karlstadt,” pp. 175-178. For the circumstances attending his banishment,

L. Diestel. Cp. “Luthers Werke,” Weim. ed., 15, p. 2, where
Diestel says: “His knowledge of Hebrew is meagre”; the literal
sense is made subservient to the “Christian and theological bias.”
H. Hering’s opinion (“Doctor Pomeranus,” Leipzig, 1888) is: In
Bugenhagen’s Commentary “the Psalmist’s states of soul are made to
represent a picture of the Reformation”; the work is “sensibly
clearer and more prosaic” than Luther’s unfinished exposition of the
Psalms.</p>

In the work called “<i>Contra novum errorem de sacramento corporis
et sanguinis Iesu Christi</i>” (end of August, 1525). See “Luthers
Werke,” Weim. ed., 19, p. 447. Zwingli replied to Bugenhagen in a
writing of October, 1525. In the “Klare Underrichtung vom Nachtmal
Christi,” which Zwingli published in February, 1526, in vindication of
his denial of the Real Presence, he, as in his previous writings, avoided
naming Luther. Since at Basle in September, 1525, [Œcolampadius
also advocated the figurative sense of the words of institution in his
writing, “<i>De genuina verborum Domini expositione</i>,” and Caspar
Schwenckfeld and Valentine Krautwald sought to propagate the same
in Silesia, while Carlstadt was winning adherents by his attacks upon
the Sacrament, Bugenhagen’s work was all the more timely. Johann
Brenz espoused his cause, in opposition to the figurative interpretation,
in his “Syngramma” of October, 1525, and so did Jacob Strauss.
The “Sacramentarian” movement had grown before Luther followed
up his vigorous refutation of Carlstadt’s denial of the Sacrament (in his
book “Widder die hymelischen Propheten,” and in his sermon of
1526 on the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ against the
fanatics) by his polemical Tractate against Zwingli and [Œcolampadius
on the words of Christ, “This is My Body” (1527). See above, p. 379 f.]

[of the devil] Acts xxix.[15] came to my mind: ‘Jesus I know and Paul
I know,’ etc. He has often troubled me ... I have not yet forgotten
what he sought to do through the Sacramentarians of Silesia
(see p. 409, n. 3). In the matter of other sins he may have seemed to
triumph over me, but, thanks be to Christ, he may indeed have come
to me, but has not been able to remain. I again exhort you herewith
that you pray for me,” etc.</p>

Kolde, in the Introduction to the 10th edition of the “Symbolische
Bücher,” p. 1. “This was the only official Confession
agreed to at the Schmalkalden Convention.” When Luther caused his
bitter “Artickel”&mdash;which had not been accepted at Schmalkalden at all
(above, p. 431)&mdash;to be printed in 1538 (“Werke,” Erl. ed., 25²,
p. 163 ff.), he nevertheless spoke of them as an official deed agreed to
at the Schmalkalden Convention, declaring: “They have also been
agreed upon unanimously by our followers and accepted, so that&mdash;were
the Pope and his adherents ever so bold as to hold a Council,
without lying and deceit but in all sincerity and truth, as he ought
to do&mdash;these Articles ought to be publicly put forward as the confession
of our faith.” Was he really ignorant of the actual facts of the case?
It was surely to his interest, after the Conference of Schmalkalden, to
inform himself exactly of the fate of his Articles. Kolde, <i>ibid.</i>, p. 61,
is of opinion that he evidently made the above assertion “in ignorance
of the negotiations which had taken place at Schmalkalden during his
illness.” Kolde, moreover, shows that Luther’s publication did not
even agree with the original as “presented at Schmalkalden”; but
contained various additions, some of them of considerable length,
though “without any alteration of meaning.”</p>

“Werke,” Erl. ed., 25², p. 251 ff.: “Ratschlag von der Kirche....
Mit einer Vorrede und Glosse M. Luthers,” 1538. The writing begins:
“The Pope with his wretched Council is like a cat with her kittens,”
and concludes (p. 277): Unchastity “is no sin at Rome.” Yet unchastity
was one of the abuses assailed in the very writing which he
here reprints, which urges that “Rome ought to be the model and
example of all other cities.” Of the ambition prevalent at Rome he
writes in his usual way (p. 253): “If all such filth were to be stirred
up in a free Council, what a stench there would be.” On the title-page
he depicts three cardinals: “Desperate knaves, bent on cleansing the
Churches with foxes’ brushes” (p. 254).</p>

Cp. the passage in the reprint of the “<i>Variata</i>,” “Corp. ref.,”

p. 41). Our quotations are from Loofs, “Dogmengesch.,”<sup>4</sup> p. 864 f.:
“In view of the new idea of the Eucharist which he gradually adopted,
we cannot doubt that Melanchthon was anxious to leave an open door
for future agreement with the Swiss.” Thus Kolde, “Symbol.

Kolde (“Symbol. Bücher”<sup>10</sup>, Einleitung, p. xxv.) characterises
the enlarging of Articles v. and xx., the stress laid on the necessity
of Penance and good works, and also Article xviii. (<i>De libero arbitrio</i>)
as “real alterations, or at any rate a watering down of their dogmatic
character.” “The chief stumbling-block proved, not indeed then,
but later, to be the wording of Article x. on the Supper.... That
it was here a question of a real change (in the doctrine of the
Eucharist) should never have been denied.”</p>
